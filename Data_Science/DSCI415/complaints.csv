Additionally some of the dates that say "" no bill being due '' were times when my loan was being transferred between servicers or my annual IBR payment was being recalculated. Is the phrase "" no bill being due '' a catch all for payments that the servicer can't figure out because of poor record keeping?

This is why I am opening up another complaint until this can be resolved fairly. 

My Original message : Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you regarding my student loan balance with American Educational Services ( AES ). During my XXXX studies, I borrowed from the lender {$9600.00} to pay for tuition and other school related expenses. After graduating in XXXX of XXXX with my degree, I begun making monthly payments to AES starting with my very first payment of {$90.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. In the last 10 years I have made 126 payments in the total amount of {$11000.00}. Today, I only owe {$9200.00}. For the past 4 months I have stopped making these monthly payments as I sought to understand how, after a decade of payments, I have only been able to pay down my debt by less than {$400.00}. I was advised by AES that to receive a response I would need to mail them a letter describing my request. My first letter was sent in early XXXX of XXXX and I have not heard back from anyone to my original letter or those thereafter. In total I have sent 4 letters address to AES and the Office of Consumer Advisory, both located in XXXX, XXXX During this time however they did report my delinquency to the credit agencies which has negatively impacted my credit score. My recent statement notes that my score has declined from a range of XXXX down to XXXX, depending on credit reporting agency. While this is not material to this particular matter it does illustrate the point that I have been a responsible consumer who has always paid their debt as well as the significant impact this has on my future credit worthiness. I have already paid back more than I have borrowed and have not been able to understand from anyone how after 10 years of payments my debt has practically not moved at all. There seems no incentive to continue making these payments for another 10, 20, 30, or potentially 40 years just for them to remain at the same amount as borrowed. I borrowed {$9600.00} with the understanding that I would have to pay that amount back with interest. I firmly believe that after {$11000.00} and 10 years of this financial and mental burden my balance should have decreased by more than {$360.00}. I seek to understand how much of the {$11000.00} should be applied to principal and I wish to settle my debt with AES by paying off the difference between my original balance of {$9600.00} and that principal amount. 

Company 's Response The Office of Consumer Advocacy ( OCA ) at Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ( PHEAA ) performed a review of your account. Please Note : PHEAA conducts its student loan servicing operations commercially as American Education Services and for federally-owned loans as FedLoan Servicing. In your inquiry you expressed concern because you believe your Privately owned XXXX loan should have been paid in full. Our review of your account determined that your Private XXXX loan was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX. In accordance with the terms of your promissory note, you agreed to pay your loan in full, including all interest, within 239 months. Your loan entered repayment on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, all outstanding, accrued interest was capitalized XXXX added to your principal balance ) and your current principal balance at that time was {$14000.00}. Your monthly installment amount is calculated to pay all principal balance and accrued interest within your maximum term of 239 months. If you make payment to pay your loan in full prior to this, you are responsible for any accrued interest, only through the date you pay your loan in full. In your inquiry, you requested to have your loan forgiven. We are unable to accommodate your request because your loan is being serviced in accordance with the terms of the promissory note that you signed.",None,AES/PHEAA,TN,37777,None,Consent provided,Web,04/26/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4327321
03/03/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"I consolidated my XXXX loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan in XXXX of XXXX. I also applied for an Income Driven Repayment Plan on XX/XX/XXXX. Fedloan Servicing incorrectly processed my income driven repayment application. I was placed on REPAYE for a payment amount of {$110.00}. I was notified of the outcome of Fedloan servicing processing my income driven repayment on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately notified Fedloan of their mistake and they acknowledged the error that Fedloan Servicing made with regard to my IDR Application and I was placed on the incorrect IDR plan for the incorrect amount for income driven repayments. After correcting the error, Fedloan Servicing, sent me a new IDR outcome letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that was correct and did list the Income Based Repayment plan for a payment amount of {$86.00}. However, in the interim timeframe Fedloan Servicing processed and sent me on XX/XX/XXXX a "" Repayment Obligation/Schedule Disclosure Statement '' form. This form listed that I would have to pay {$13000.00} over the entire life of my Direct Consolidation Loan. Of that amount, {$2400.00} would be interest that I would pay over the life of my Direct Consolidation Loan. Since this form was created by a mistake via an error that Fedloan Servicing has accepted responsibility for I have asked on numerous attempts to be sent a new and "" correct '' version of the "" Repayment Obligation/Schedule Disclosure Statement '' that will list my payment plan as IBR and the total amount and interest amount I will be required to pay over the lifetime of my Direct Consolidation Loan. As of XX/XX/XXXX Fedloan Servicing has not provided me an updated and correct version of the Repayment Obligation/Schedule Disclosure Statement form. I am very unhappy about this. When I applied for a mortgage, when I applied for a car loan I was provided a Federal Truth-in-Lending form that provided me very clearly and directly the amount I would be required to pay both in total terms and interest amount over the lifetime of my car loan and mortgage. Fedloan Servicing seems to believe that Student Loan Borrowers are not worthy of the same types of consumer protection and to be clearly and directly informed of their loan terms. At least Fedloan does not believe in providing correct information. Fedloan made a mistake, was informed of that mistake, but has yet to rectify the sitution by providing a CORRECT version of the Repayment Obligation/Schedule Disclosure Statement. That is what I am asking the CFPB to look into.

I'm guessing they assigned Nelnet to manage my student loans. It's been a nightmare ever since. Nelnet falsely reported late payments to the consumer reporting agencies of my student loan accounts that ended up dropping my scores from the low 700s to the mid 400s. Those late payments were false because on each of those days that they claim the account was late, I was in forbearance ( proof has been attached directly fro, the studentaid.gov website. ) These inaccuracies have taken a big toll on my life. They've ruined my reputation on my consumer reports which has led to me being denied credit on so many occasions. It's bad enough being an XXXX American male in this country and how difficult it is to be extended credit. Nelnet made it even worse for me! Theyve prevented me from getting credit cards, apartments, jobs and I can't even qualify for a car. This has forced me to move backwards in these rebuilding times. I've been declined 2 good paying jobs twice because they thought those inaccurate late payments reflected on my character as a person or mean Id come late every day. 

I've also had to live in very undesirable situations because my credit wasn't 'good enough ' for me to live in a better neighborhood. I disputed the late payments with the bureaus in JXX/XX/XXXX and they put them back within 10 days after they were removed per nelnet 's request without even contacting me and I didn't receive a single proof or reason why those inaccuracies were put back on my account. 

I've spoken to someone from nelnet but the the most recent was on the XX/XX/XXXX in the afternoon. I spoke with a woman named XXXX and explained to her how this company has ruined my life by reporting all those inaccuracies and she told there's nothing she can do. After suggesting to speak to someone above her multiple times, she told me she would dispute them for me that's the best she can do and that I'll receive the results in the mail. 

I asked her how long it'll take for me to see those results and she said it'd take 4-5 business days. This was a Friday so I expected a response by Monday XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. Til this day I haven't got a response from them.

04/30/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My complaint is with Coast Professional Services, and the US Department of Education. Coast has continually and systematically mishandled documents, failed to correspond, prematurely terminated payment arrangements, and performed other acts in a sustained effort to violate my rights as a borrower, all with the goal of continuing to charge usurious fees to which they are not entitled, and to keep my account in collections for their own financial gain. The US Department of Education is included in this complaint because they have provided false information to me, have also lost documentation, have refused to address my concerns, have refused to recall the loan from Coast in accordance with their own policy, and have appeared to aid and abet Coast 's illegal collection practices. I have made no less than 5 separate attempts to enter into a loan rehabilitation with Coast, as well as directly with the Department of Education. In each instance, paperwork was claimed to have been lost, documentation was claimed to have not been received, required correspondence was not sent to me, requests have been denied without due process, documents sent in perfect condition were altered to be made illegible, and other actions counter to regulations and in violation of my rights as a borrower. The most recent example begins in XX/XX/XXXX, where I contacted the Dept of Ed to make one of many attempts to rehabilitate my loan. I was told to forward my request directly to the Dept of Ed, which I did immediately. I received tacit confirmation of the receipt of my complete request, since I received a separate correspondence from the Dept of Ed regarding the enclosed {$600.00} payment, and stating that the payment should have been forwarded to a different address from my request. I continued to make payments directly to the Dept of Ed for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, each payment being {$600.00}, which exceeds the amount given by the Department of Ed during my XX/XX/XXXX phone call. Having not received any response from Dept of Ed, I contacted the agency on XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX. At that time I was informed that the Dept of Ed representative in XX/XX/XXXX gave me incorrect information, and the request could not be processed directly with Dept of Ed. The Dept of Ed then advised me that the request and all documents were scanned and forwarded to Coast. I was advised that I could issue a complaint against Coast, and if they fail to respond, the loan can be recalled from Coast and rehabilitated through Dept of Ed directly. I issued the complaint on that day. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a response from Coast dated XX/XX/XXXX. In that response, Coast did not address the status of the loan rehabilitation request that was sent in XX/XX/XXXX, instead, Coast conflated the request with another previous request from XXXX. XXXX stated that the documentation was illegible. I contacted Dept of Ed on XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX. I was informed that Dept of Ed scanned the documents to Coast, but that the scan, performed by Dept of Ed, was not legible. The original documents were no longer available. The two supervisors that I spoke with refused to correct the document scan. They refused to address the incorrect response from Coast. Despite the original assistor on the phone being able to see the Coast letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, and even reviewing the contents, both supervisors claimed that they did not have access to the letter. Again, this was despite the fact that the original assistor was able to volunteer specific details of the letter. In the midst of asking for instructions on how to escalate the complaint, the supervisor ( name and id available upon request ) disconnected the call without cause. It appears that the Dept of Ed is colluding with Coast in an effort to keep my loan in collections, for profit. It is important to me to clear this up, and I have acted in good faith at every turn, over the course of years, only to be thwarted by both Coast and Dept of Ed. I have made payments, and submitted documentation. I have dutifully contacted both Coast and Dept of Ed. My efforts have been nullified by both Coast and the Dept of Ed. This has been motivated by profit, and has been to the detriment of myself, and my family both financially and career wise. The resolution that I'm seeking is that Dept of Ed recalls the loan, so that I am able to make payments directly with Dept of Ed. I am also asking that the negative results on my credit report be removed, as they are the direct result of Coast and Dept of Ed 's negligent, malicious, and capricious actions, recognizing my good faith efforts to pay my student loans. I am asking that Coast be disallowed from charging fees on this debt to which they are not entitled. And I am asking that I am given the chance to pay the full amount of the loan as agreed, and in a timely manner, to the Dept of Ed. I am not asking for an elimination of the debt, as I have benefited from my education in ways that I couldn't have imagined. I want to pay. I want to be in good standing. But Coast and Department of Education are colluding to make that impossible, and I hope to have your help in correcting this folly. I will gladly provide any details you may need.

XX/XX/XXXX - I applied for PSLF XX/XX/XXXX - Fedloan Servicing notified me that I did not qualify for PSLF XX/XX/XXXX - I applied for TEPSLF XX/XX/XXXX - Fedloan Servicing denied my application stating that I did not apply for PSLF ( not true ) XXXX XXXX - I resubmitted PSLF application XX/XX/XXXX - Denied again for PSLF ; Reapplied for TEPSLF XX/XX/XXXX - Fedloan Servicing denied TEPSLF, stating that I did not have all 12 qualifying payments ( I think I was 2 short ) XX/XX/XXXX - Spoke to Fedloan representative who told me I should now DEFINITELY qualify for TEPSLF ; I applied for TEPSLF XX/XX/XXXX - I received an email from Fedloan Servicing stating that I did not qualify for TEPSLF due to not having 120 qualifying payments ( a major change from 12 qualifying payments ) XXXX XXXX - Submitted a complaint to CFPB ( # XXXX ), because Fedloans changed the qualifying terms. 

XXXX XXXX - Fedloan representative claimed they did not change the term of the loan, and that I did not qualify for other reasons they could not explain.

XX/XX/XXXX - I spoke with a supervisor at Fedloan Servicing regarding my qualifying payments and why I did not qualify for TEPSLF. She said 2 of my loans still did not qualify ( this made no sense to me ), but she assured me that I would qualify in XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Prepared to resubmit my request for TEPSLF but discovered Fedloans had once again changed the requirements from 12 to 120 qualifying payments.

Navient continued demanding payment as usual and unexpectedly withdrew my monthly payment in XX/XX/XXXX per autopay, causing me significant financial distress at the worst possible time. They later agreed to reverse the payment and put me in some kind of forbearance, but never clearly explained how long it would last or when I would have to start paying again.

Navient suddenly began demanding payment again in XXXX of XXXX even though the pandemic was still raging and I was still unemployed. I found out about their demand when I was charged a late fee. I asked for additional relief because of the pandemic and they refused. My only options were 1 ) use up my few remaining months of regular forbearance and then begin making payments again somehow despite having hardly any income, or 2 ) pursue a consolidation loan so I could have additional forbearance opportunities, which they encouraged me to do.

The payment was authorized electronically during this call and I asked how long would it take before I would receive a letter staying the account had been settled. I was informed it would take about 30 days for the letter to be sent to me. The payment of {$3400.00} was withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX.

The recruiters also promised that students would receive robust career support as they looked for a job upon completing the program. This supposed support was said to include help getting connected to employers that the school had a relationship with and being referred to full-time well paying positions. These two reason were pivotal to me deciding to attend the school. Upon completing the program, I sought to receive career help. The only support I received from the school was to get connected with a few temporary part-time gigs. While I took these opportunities, I continued to see if they would be able to connect me with full-time opportunities, as they promised.

They had me sign these 5 times over my time at XXXX. There was them 5 loans. When I graduated ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and began getting my bills I realized they were private loans.

On XX/XX/XXXX I reached on to them about how my account. They informed me that I am past due by {$93.00}, they apparently had made an error and made in incorrect payment on my account. I asked for statements showing the error, how they fixed it and correspondence to correct me not being late on payments due to not being notified of the error when they tried to correct it, retroactively applying back the loan and not being late on any statement payments. They said they would get back with me. This took about an hour on the phone to get to this point. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating I was 10 days past due for {$93.00}. I reached back out to them since this is the first thing I have received since reaching out to them.

No letter, no correspondence, no corrected statements, no reasoning for the error nothing. Just that I had to take it for their word. I did not accept this as I have no statements with correct amounts or any information on how they made an error or corrected it. Was told they would get back with me again and would not correct or figure out the situation with me on the phone and that I would need to wait XXXX business days. 

After trying to fix this multiple times and getting no where. I feel that this could affect multiple things, like credit report, interests being applied to the loan, higher rates later when I consolidate due to multiple late payments. All this after already taking multiple hours out of my time to try correct an error they made. Also was never contacted by them to inform me of this error once they noticed it and tried to retroactively apply the loan making me "" past due '' for a statement I never received.

I was told they are working for the U.S Department of Education, working with Public Service Loan Forgiveness. On XX/XX/2021 I called back to discuss forgiveness options. I was told I would have immediate relief and very small monthly payments. I was told that my other loans would be taken care of immediately and upon looking today, XX/XX/2021, and I still have my student loans due for this month. I was told I would have 4 monthly payments to start of {$190.00}. They automatically took out {$190.00} on XX/XX/2021, and it will happen again this month on the XXXX. I believe I am being scammed due to reading upon reviews of this conpany. All of my sensitive information was taken right off the bat and I, unfortunately did not give a second thought to it. I was not told where or even who my payments were going to. Looking upon my bank statements on XX/XX/2021, it looks like it's called BCO Consulting Services.

07/08/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have a Federal parent loan that went into consolidation/repayment in XXXX for {$110000.00}. I have never missed a payment and I've been on automatic payments for a long time. In late XX/XX/XXXX I called to change my automatic payment amount. I spoke to a young man and he took the new information and said it was all set up. I received a call in I believe in late XXXX to say I had missed payment and asked if I could make it then. I explained why I was confused and she explained that autopay had ended but no new account had been set up. I made a payment for the missed payment that day with her over the phone and then she explained I had to complete the forbearance process in order to set autopay up again ( I receive a 0.25 % interest rate discount for autopay, so I didn't want to lose this. ) I completed this process with her and she set up my autopay from that day forward. I received a notification that my monthly payment went up from {$500.00} to {$540.00}. The loan has XXXX more months before payoff. That approximately {$45.00} in increase monthly payment means I would pay an additional {$7.00} over the remaining loan payoff period. I called to find out what had happened : how can a change in direct pay account cause this? First, it is impossible to find a customer service number. So I wrote an email. I received a response that basically said "" you went into forbearance and this is the recalculation due to capitalized interest. '' The email provided me a phone number, so I called today. The first person confused me and I kept asking drill-down questions. How can this happen : I never missed a payment, I simply wanted to change accounts, and now I'm scheduled to pay + $ XXXX. She explained that a change of direct pay accounts is considered a forbearance because it takes them time to set it up and therefore a payment is missed. I explained that I didn't miss a payment, that I made the payment the day I found out the account had not been set up on my initial call. She said that there was about {$210.00} in interest for the forbearance period that was capitalized and this changed my payment. I continued to ask about why this was necessary and we were disconnected (? ). I called back and eventually, receiving no better answers from the second representative, asked to speak with a supervisor. Ultimately, the supervisor removed the forbearance action and the capitalized interest. She said this took off a few dollars from my new payment ; it is now {$540.00} per month ( vs. {$540.00} ). She explained that the other increase in the monthly payment is due to the account being audited and this higher amount was put in place so that I can pay the loan off in the time period set forth in the beginning ( 30 years ). What? I tried to see my payment history and while it says the loan was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX, the website only shows payments back to XX/XX/XXXX. During this period I paid about {$26000.00} in interest. With the time left to repay, It looks like I will pay an additional {$26000.00} in interest. I would like this loan audited by someone to see if all this is correct.

My student loan journey is not an uncommon one. Upon graduating in XX/XX/XXXX, I was not told about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program or anything of the sort. Not by my school XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA ) during student loan exit counseling or by any one of my several servicers at the time ( XXXX, Nelnet, Great Lakes, etc. ). 

After my 6 month new grad deferment I started repaying my loans in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by a former classmate of mine about the PSLF program and immediately requested more info and had to do my own research about it as my servicers were not very helpful at this time. To my surprise, despite receiving government loans for XXXX XXXX, some of my loans did not qualify for the program and that I would need to forfeit 12 months of payments in order to consolidate my FFEL loans to a Direct Loan despite working full time for a qualifying employer under the correct income based repayment ( IBR ) plan at that time. 

Fast forward 10+ years and I have been lucky enough to help thousands of patients in the public sector through many different issues including helping well over 400+ COVID patients in the last year regain their strength, mobility and quality of life. The lessons I have learned and the relationships that I have gained working in the XXXX XXXX XXXX have been invaluable for my personal and professional growth. I only have 9.5 months left until I can apply for PSLF forgiveness at this time. If that year of FFEL payments would be counted I would have been done by now. Sadly I am not alone. Many others are in much worse shape than I am due to vast malfeasance and misinformation not only by the Education Department ( ED ) but many student loan servicers and schools. 

PSLF reform needs to happen. That is obvious. A quick internet search can find hundreds of similar stories of the predatory student loan system that has continued to only get worse. The ED and schools need to be giving students ALL the options regarding repayment and forgiveness towards their student loans. I have heard that a 90 day audit of the PSLF program is potentially happening before the currently scheduled payment restart date of XX/XX/XXXX. I am asking not only for a deep dive into current practices but to strongly consider counting the FFEL and any other loans for those that have worked 10 years in the public sector towards PSLF whether it be through the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( TEPSLF ) or otherwise. We have upheld our end of the agreement by working 10 years in the public sector now it is the governments turn to uphold their end and offer forgiveness. 

Thousands of employees that have diligently served in the public sector from teachers to healthcare workers to military and every other public job out there across this great country would greatly appreciate it. I do not expect my story to change much with the current student loan landscape that we are navigating but I hope this letter sparks conversation and positive change if not for myself then for the many borrowers that are coming after me.

According to each rep that I've spoken to, my application for a deferment was approved after I paid the {$100.00} good faith payment ( twice ). But, despite this, the deferment has not been processed on my account so I'm about to go into collections. I just spoke to Sallie Mae once more on XX/XX/XXXX and they admitted to me that they saw all of the notes on my account showing that my forebearance was in fact approved with a confirmation number of # XXXX. On this XX/XX/XXXX call, the representative I spoke to admitted that if my account did get reported to the credit bureaus then Sallie Mae would remove it because the error is theirs. I am worried nonetheless because every single time I've called them ( once a week ) the representative that I've spoken to has advised me that my account would be ok and it would just be a few more days until my forebearance processed. 

Further call details below : XX/XX/XXXX : I called to ask about repayment options and applied for a forebearance. Paid the {$100.00} good faith payment and was told my account would be current in 3-5 business days. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I noticed that I was still getting urgent past due emails so I called again to check in on my forebearance. The agent that I spoke to had me re-apply, pay another {$100.00} good faith payment, and informed me that my application would be approved because he was the one approving it now. 

XXXX : I received a voicemail from a Sallie Mae agent named XXXX who advised me to call her to remedy my account. When I called her back, she said the forebearance wasn't reflected on my account but she did see it in my notes but wasn't sure why my account was still in collections. She told me she would call me back after escalating it for immediate approval to her manager. 

XXXX : XXXX still hadn't called me back so I decided to reach back out to Sallie Mae. I spoke to a new agent who informed me that XXXX did escalate the case to her manager ( according to the notes ) and my forebearance was approved. She said there was a backlog due to the XXXX XXXX holiday but my forebearance would be reflected in my account by Monday or Tuesday. 

XXXX : My account still hasn't been updated so I reached back out to Sallie Mae. The agent I spoke to reviewed my account, saw all of the notes, and escalated the issue to her XXXX. Her manager had her put in yet another forebearance application. She told me that the error was on Sallie Mae 's part so if my account was reported to the credit bureaus then they'd remove it.

07/14/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I signed up for automatic pay with my NJCLASS loans account. I did this so that I could prevent any future payment issues coming up from XXXX, as I know that missing a student loan payment can have severe consequences on one 's credit score. That day, {$78.00} was taken out of my account. The same amount was taken out the following month, XX/XX/XXXX, and I assumed that that was what I was expected to pay moving forward. Then in XXXX, that amount changed to {$150.00}. When I called NJCLASS to ask about the amount increase, they suggested that it was due to the additional small loan that I requested for the spring semester. This made sense to me, so I went along with. 

Then came XXXX, when yet again, my payment spiked up to {$310.00}. This time when I called ( and I did this several times due to confusion on their end ), I was given no clear answer about the sudden change. They summed it up to a missed payment, which I explained made no sense since I was enrolled in THEIR automatic payment program to avoid this exact problem. Nonetheless, I was given the run around and after many frustrating calls, I gave up and hoped they would figure out the set payment amount by next month. And for the next 3 months, it seemed like they had finally sorted it out. For the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, I was charged a set rate of {$240.00}, and I budgeted accordingly for such. So you can imagine how disappointed I was to wake up today, XX/XX/XXXX to a negative sum in my bank account. This month I was charged {$360.00}, for which I was not ( and couldn't have ever been ) prepared for. The little money that I had put aside for other bills ( besides the expected XXXX ), was taken with no forewarning. 

I called the NJCLASS office the moment I woke up to the overdrawn alert from my bank, and was told that this whole time, my monthly payment amount had been set incorrectly. I was not being charged the full amount I owed since signing up for the Automatic payment system in XXXX, and because of said faulty system, I was seriously behind on payments. Not only is this current month 's payment incorrect, the past year 's payments have also been incorrect. Because of this, I now owe an additional delinquency amount of {$370.00}, with no way to pay for it. My actual monthly payment was supposed to have been {$480.00} a month this whole time. Had the Autopay done its intended job and charged me the full amount, this would not have happened. I also would have made the proper arrangements/decisions to ensure that I had the extra {$240.00} in my account every month. Because their system failed, I am left with less than no money, and no way to compensate for other important bills, let alone this one. I pleaded with the office for some kind of relief/assistance, especially since they themselves admitted to it being an error on their end. I was given nothing. I have just unsubscribed from the Autopay system, but the damage has already been done. This situation has affected both my mother and my credit scores negatively, and of course we had no way of knowing that this could have happened. I would have expected a government agency to at least have their Autopay system down, and I can't be the only one experiencing this, not to mention in the midst of this global pandemic.

I will list each below. What they have done is taken off the interest amount and just added it to the principal of the loan. Resulting in my loan increasing during a lawful stay on loans. I'm sure this is not legal or complies with the lending standards. 

Fraud charge # 1 : XXXX XXXXUnsubsidized on XX/XX/XXXX of {$69.00} increase Fraud charge # 2 : XXXX XXXX-Unsubsidized on XX/XX/XXXX of {$240.00} increase Fraud charge # 3 : XXXX XXXX-Subsidized on XX/XX/XXXX of {$63.00} increase Loans XXXX & XXXX XXXX are also reflecting a 6.8 % interest active. 

Second, this caused me to look further into the insanely high balance reflected currently with my account. All these years I haven't had the time to dig in and pursue. I do have that time now. You are showing my total balance of {$76000.00}. 
Adding up all the loans reflecting on my account including interest, loans that were previously cancelled ( i'll explain this further next ), including all costs possible you have on there. I am coming up with a very different number. Including all listed the total amount actually is {$70000.00} at max. This does not include any payments made. Now, unless my calculator and education I paid too much for is failing me that is an issue on their part. I would like to think this would be a simple mistake or oversight from them, otherwise this would be taking advantage of students that are already struggling with costs for higher education.

It is 118 days later, as of today, and my balance of {$87000.00} has not yet been forgiven. 
I contacted FedLoan by chat on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed by XXXX, employee # XXXX, that A request has been submitted to have the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) and Temporary Expanded PSLF ( TEPSLF ) Certification and Application ( PSLF & TEPSLF Application ) reviewed. We will notify you once the review is complete. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, having received no updates, I filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and requested an update from FedLoan directly. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply from the XXXX XXXX XXXX for my case # XXXX. The reply, signed by FedLoan, confirmed that I had made over 120 qualifying payments, and stated your account will undergo a rigorous review for accuracy and completeness and that there is no specific time frame for the completed review. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I also received a reply from FedLoan, Reference ID : XXXX, stating Please allow 2-3 months for this review to be completed due to the amount of extensive research involved with reviewing the qualifying payments and employment. 
I responded that same day that I had ALREADY waited 100  days ( more than the 2-3 months requested ) since the XX/XX/XXXX letter certifying that I had made over 120 qualifying payments and requested a more complete accounting of the status of my application. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply from FedLoan again confirming that you have earned at least 120 qualifying payments on your loans towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Furthermore, the letter stated the final determination review started on XX/XX/XXXX. The final determination review may take up to 180 days for complete processing. 
Based on this reply, the final review of my application did not even begin until 3 days AFTER I filed a complaint that 100 days had passed since the letter from FedLoan certifying my qualification for loan forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX. 
To be asked to wait up to another 180 days for complete processing is simply unacceptable and amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty of the Department of Education to honor the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of XXXX. 
I followed the rules of the PSLF program. My application for student loan forgiveness does not include any request for exception, expansion of eligibility, investigation on if my job qualifies, etc. There is no need to investigate the quality of the education I received. There is no reason for this delay. It is a straightforward application, cleanly within the parameters of the PSLF program set forth in XXXX which I have been following for 10 years. This review should take no more than 7-10 days.

I completed multiple certification forms over the duration of my 10-year repayment period to make sure I was on track for forgiveness. I have worked for one employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, during my repayment period. I consolidated my loans so that they would qualify for the PSLF program. My payments were in an income-based repayment program to ensure they would qualify. A rigorous review for accuracy and completeness to verify these basic facts should not take over 118 days. To require such time for a final determination is a willful failure, by intent, to honor the commitments set forth in the law. Delays of this magnitude are nothing less than intentional criminal negligence. 
In essence, the Department of Education is defrauding the very individuals who have dedicated their careers to public service. How can it be justified that the government treats its own employees, who earned a high-quality education, contributed to the public good, and followed the details of the PSLF program, with such ineptitude and disdain? I have always been an advocate for the power of government to serve the people and have personally striven in my career to be a steward of good governance. As a prior service member and as a federal employee, I have always taken great pride in my public service. 
However, this experience with the Department of Education has frustrated and angered me. How can it be that a program meant to entice highly educated people to serve in government became so poorly managed that it disenchants employees from federal service? 
Simply, the Department of Education, through their mismanagement of the PSLF program, has broken the trust and confidence public servants should have in their own government. 180 days to verify I paid my student loans according to PSLF requirements? That is nothing less than an insult and reflects poorly on the efficacy of the United States Government. Instead of looking for new pools of students to forgive debt, how about you start by honoring those that studied in an accredited program, served their nation, and followed the rules 120 times over the last 10 years.",None,AES/PHEAA,AE,09714,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,06/21/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4476718

I only wanted to wrestle. 

As an adult I am better with money and recognize the consequences of my actions from over 11 years ago. Unfortunately Navient is very hard to work with. You student loans are in 3 different departments, Government, Governement back, and Private student loans. Each department has it own programs and don't talk to each other, so when you have 20 student loans it is easy for Navient people to make mistakes. They signed me up for 18 % interest rate. I have basically been on a rate reduction plan for the private loans for the last 10 years and have never paid the government loans. Every six months they want to call and discuss my income situation over again. I also get harrassed by employees for making life decisions like buying a car or house. They tell me I should be calling them before taking out new debt. It is very draining considering the yoyo ride my income has gone on over the last 10 years. It should not be legal for them to hold an 18 % debt over my head and not consider locking in a rate longer than 6 months. They are the only negative reporting information on my credit. So I can not refinance the loans, they keep increasing the monthly payment so paying back federal also becomes impossible. Not sure what this email will do but I though someone should know. 

The purpose of Student loans and Navient was to improve my life. I now feel like a slave to the debt and I keep getting harassed by the company every 6 months because they want me to pay 18 % interest.

07/20/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"FedLoan Servicing ( aka PHEAA ) has repeatedly caused delays in processing my loans which lead to me being unable to make a qualifying payment under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

Essentially my claim is that repeated administrative errors on FedLoan 's part have deprived me of 4 qualifying payments, despite the fact that my employments has been certified as PSLF-qualifying from an unbroken period from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. My claims break down into two categories : 1 ) I should be permitted to make a "" catch-up '' PSLF-qualfying payment of {$240.00} for XX/XX/XXXX and be given credit for a "" catch-up '' qualifying payment for XX/XX/XXXX which I've already been permitted to pay. PSLF failed to notify me of the ability to do so during a window that they permitted earlier and has since recognized that I deserved to make a qualifying payment for one and not the other.

FedLoan failed to properly transfer my paperwork when I transferred loans from XXXX XXXX in XXXX. During that time, they were unable to bill me and instead put me into forbearance for XX/XX/XXXX. As documented in XX/XX/XXXX, I was no longer in forbearance, but instead "" a payment was not due. '' FedLoan later admitted their error in a letter that I have now obtained, dated XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Ex. Q. ) In that letter, I was told to provide "" catch-up '' payments by XX/XX/XXXX and they would qualify. Unfortunately, I never received that letter and only got a copy in XXXX when I began disputing these issues with FedLoan. When FedLoan claims they sent the letter ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I was in the military, so perhaps I missed it because of that, but regardless, I never received that letter. FedLoan also never called me to confirm receipt or advise me of this information, nor did they advise me of this in many calls I've placed trying to get this fixed. Therefore, the deadline passed without me ever becoming aware of the fact that FedLoan 's issues in transferring my loans lead to me missing two qualifying payments. Given that FedLoan was able to permit me to make a "" catch-up '' payment after the fact and admitted the fault on their part, I should be able to make those same catch-up payments now that I am aware of the ability to do so.

2 ) I should be permitted to make two "" catch-up '' PSLF-qualfying for XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, as I was improperly denied credit due to a repeated XXXX cent billing error on FedLoan 's part that they failed to catch, never explained, after which they forced me into forbearance : I requested to be moved from IBR to PAYE in XXXX of XXXX. I received confirmation of this request on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Ex. A ). In that XX/XX/XXXX letter, I was told that I would be put on either the standard plan or a reduced payment forbearance plan. I was told "" to remit payment no later than 15 days after the due date '' and that, if I did so, I would then be switched over to the new requested repayment plan ( PAYE ). I then requested a reduced payment forbearance for my XX/XX/XXXX plan, which was confirmed in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. ( see Ex. C ) That letter stated that I needed to make a reduced forbearance payment and, although I did not see it at the time, it said the payment should be {$5.00}. It also stated that FedLoan would "" continue to send a monthly notification reminding [ me ] to make [ my payment ]. 

However, in that subsequent notification, my monthly bill of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX then stated that the amount due was {$4.00}. ( See exhibit D ). I can't recall exactly what happened, but for some reason my account did not direct debit on XX/XX/XXXX even though I had not requested a suspension ( perhaps this happens automatically ). When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told simply to make the reduced payment forbearance listed on my bill, at which point I could transfer out of my old IBR payment. ( See Ex. P, XXXX Call History entry for XX/XX/XXXX ). At no point was it made clear that I should ignore the amount due on my bill, and instead go off of another number that was listed on a different letter. Accordingly, on the same day, I paid what FedLoan had billed me : {$4.00} ( See Ex. E, pg 5, noting {$4.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX ). Given that this was within 15 days of the payment due date, and was the amount billed, this should have completed my transition from IBR to PAYE per the instructions in Exhibit A and I should have been able to make qualifying payments on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX under PAYE. 

Yet on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another FedLoan bill, once again asking me to pay {$4.00}, this time by XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Ex. F ). It acknowledged that I had just paid on XX/XX/XXXX but for some reason did not count that as qualifying for the reduced payment forbearance, even though it was the same amount now being billed. The very next day, I received another letter, telling me that, rather than paying {$4.00}, I now owed {$2600.00}. ( See Ex. G ). Panicking after seeing two different numbers from FedLoan in two days, and not wanting to have {$2600.00} autodebited from my account for no discernible reason, I suspended direct debit the same day. ( See Ex. H ). I also called FedLoan again on XX/XX/XXXX and was advised once again to make an IBR opt-out payment and to "" wait to receive the reduced bill prior to making the payment. '' So once again, FedLoan told me explicitly to base my payment on the reduced bill, which told me to pay {$4.00}. 

Based on that phone call, I manually made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, of the amount once again listed on my bill - {$4.00}. ( See Ex. E, p. 5 ). I called FedLoan on XX/XX/XXXX and "" was advised that since an additional payment was made, the IBR opt out can proceed. '' ( See Ex. P, call history ). So although I should have been able to get credit for XX/XX/XXXX because I paid the required XX/XX/XXXX amount within 15 days, I was explicitly advised over the phone that I would begin switching over after XX/XX/XXXX into PAYE and should definitely have gotten credit for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Instead, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification once again that my account would be autodebited the standard amount of {$2600.00} ( see Ex. I ) and, even more troublingly, was sent a bill on XX/XX/XXXX telling me that I had failed to make a previous standard payment AND owed a new standard payment, so the bill was now for {$5200.00} ( see Ex. J ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally approved for PAYE, but inexplicably, my first XXXX payment was not effective until XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Ex. K ). The same day I was approved, I also received a delinquency notice telling me I still owed {$2600.00} from XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Ex. L ). Panicking, I called FedLoan, who once again confirmed that the PAYE change was completed, but could not explain why I would have owed {$2600.00} for either XXXX or XXXX since I had been approved for reduced payment forbearance and had now made qualifying payments TWICE. Not once did they recognize the billing error that had led to this issue, and they said my options were either to pay more than {$5000.00} or be put into forbearance. Panicking and frustrated, I requested to be put into forbearance until XXXX, since I could not afford to pay {$5200.00}. ( See Ex. O ). 

I should never have been put in forbearance. While I recognize that I could never have gotten credit for XX/XX/XXXX, since I would have to make a reduced payment forbearance and that should have qualified, I paid the amount FedLoan billed me within 15 days of XX/XX/XXXX. I then paid it AGAIN in advance of XX/XX/XXXX. I'm guessing the issue is that FedLoan 's bill was for the incorrect amount, since now I see from the other letters that {$5.00} was required and not {$4.00}, but over two billing cycles and multiple calls, no one from FedLoan ever told me the problem could be solved by simply paying an additional cent. In fact, to the contrary, I was advised by FedLoan in XXXX that I had successfully made a payment and would be transferred to the new payment plan. Even after I was told my PAYE plan was approved, I was still being billed incorrectly. I should have been able to make PAYE payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and should have the opportunity to do so as "" catch-up '' payments now. 

I have contacted the PHEAA Office of Consumer Advocacy, which resulted in them granting me the catch-up payment for XX/XX/XXXX but denying the rest, despite the fact that I was unable to make a XX/XX/XXXX payment under the exact same circumstances. ( They also had previously denied that I was eligible to make a catch-up payment for XX/XX/XXXX in an earlier CFPB complaint, so they are also internally inconsistent in that manner. ) I also have a case with the US Department of Education Federal Student Aid Ombudsman on second level appeal - they have been trying to get an answer from PHEAA/FedLoan for more than six months but instead, FedLoan has apparently refused to answer them ( according to their e-mails, the first and last of which I am attaching ).",None,AES/PHEAA,KY,40503,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/20/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4558445

We know student loans can not be dcd via bankruptcy unless undue hardship can be proven. However something told me to research the loan that I had. I took out what was called tuition saver loan which is considered a non traditional student loan. This was a loan they offered for students only which was sent directly to the student to do basically whatever they wanted. Which I took advantage of to help with bills and whatnot as being a young single parent full time student part time job.

06/22/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Navient mislead me into paying thousands of dollars in interest. It was never clear they were allocating my payments nearly all to interest, and Ive never seen this kind of loan now that Ive unearthed the details. 

When the first documents came- XXXX- I didn't even understand I would pay $ XXXX/month for ( 3 ) years and pay nothing at all towards the principle of the loan, and that payments would balloon to $ XXXX/month after that time. I called Navient and got advice every year in how to lower my monthly payment- and it didnt occur to me how I was misled and steered into the worst possible plans for myself- while Navient was bilking me out of thousands of dollars in interest. 

15 years later- the obvious lies of their representatives made me dig deeper- to find out with a 4.75 % rate over 15 years -- I had already paid nearly {$11000.00} in interest and only a little more than {$4000.00} in principal on an {$18000.00} loan. My total due is still over {$14000.00}. 

As of today, I paid ~ $ XXXX on an $ XXXX loan and still owe nearly $ XXXX. This is predatory lending. 

If this was ever clear to me- I would have intervened sooner. The Navient website is not clear in any way- not like any other lender that provides clear and reasonable information on your loan. Nothing like a mortgage, credit card or other loan provider- they obfuscate the lenders information to mislead intentionally. 

XXXX : It was not clear that I would be charged interest for all of my unemployment deferment- but I was. Navient reps often say, You wont be charged interest on XXXX portion of your loan!! because they are obfuscating how much interest you will be accruing. 
How much of the loan is subsidized? Can I even see this XXXX the site? because if so- very unclear. 

XXXX : I also asked about the CARES act in XXXX only to be again mislead into a plan that still accrued interest- though I was eligible to go into 0 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX. Costing me hundreds of dollars unnecessarily. 

XXXX : I submitted an application for a new IBD that was denied twice due to me making too much income. I reviewed the income terms and knew this to be untrue. 

After calling ( 3 ) times- a rep admitted I had answered one question incorrectly -- and that is why the application was denied. She helped me change it and then I was approved. However, if one rep had guided me correctly or any correspondence- I would have known the one mistake and corrected it prior to the end date of my old term. Its unclear if I was or was not charged interest for their failure to guide me into how to correct the application. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- Last month when the IBR was finally renewed- I called to see if the monthly payment could be a little lower just based on the fact I had only recently returned to full-time work. Again- I followed the advice of the Navient rep- who said if I paid her {$120.00} today she would put my on a plan for $ XXXX/month. I did not feel comfortable making a payment over the phone and told her as much- but she insisted. I acquiesced and paid- only to check the next week my next payment would not be {$60.00} as promised- but {$670.00} instead. 

It came to my attention that the plan she said I was eligible for- I was not. She literally took money over the phone from me in a fraudulent act of misrepresentation, a verbal contract in which she had no intention of upholding. 

Ive been in contact with the DOE Ombudsman, and was put in touch with XXXX XXXX from the Office of the Customer Advocate. 

She has inferred she removed {$400.00} from my principle balance- but literally she must added the same amount to interest owed- because my total balance is the same as before my dispute. 

Heres a screen shot of my account history from today- can you tell what is going on? I can not.

Please help. I have an excellent credit score, was late twice in 15 years on these payments- and feel very duped and taken advantage of. Im trying desperately to consolidate and change providers -- but have been advised a few times by XXXX XXXX to wait until she concludes this case for Navient. She even charged me interest while I waited the past month for a resolution, despite telling me she would not. 

I dont think I should owe interest for the time I couldve been in 0 % interest due to the CARES actand they should allocate some of the interest they have taken in payments and put it where I thought it would go- principal. 

All of the attached documents say {$0.00} in Interest or Capitalized interest and seem to mislead the borrower into thinking they are not paying thousands only in interest. How is this legal? 

Navient has added {$400.00} interest owed SINCE I ASKED THEM TO START THE INVESTIGATION when I had {$20.00} interest owed, as is shown in the image below dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of XXXX I owed {$21.00} interest, since I was put on a forbearance based on my requesting an investigation and wanting to change loan servicers. Why do I now 20 days later- owe nearly {$400.00} in interest? 






XXXX XXXX is very articulate in being deceptive while wronging students. She sounds sane and compassionate until you realize she is delaying borrowers from moving servicers, lying, and then adding debt arbitrarily to my loan balance. 

If subpoenaed- phone calls between us- will clearly show XXXX advising me that my interest rate will go up if I consolidate, and inferring it is not in my best interest to do so.

She is a customer specialist with Navient.

Above is as of today in Navient portal- reflecting nearly {$400.00} MORE than the principle stated by Ms. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I asked why my balance was now higher- she indicated its interest owed. This is theft. 
I did not agree to any terms that would allow for this as I wait for the end of their investigation. 
I feel emotional distress at being lied to and deceived, during a time when I was managing grave family issues.

Your client, the Department of Education, claims that it holds legally binding promissory notes. Your client is responsible for validating such claims and the corresponding monetary demands. In accordance with case law, ( citing ) as assignees, the XXXX Agencies and other secondary holders step into the shoes of the lender from whom they have taken the promissory notes and are subject to any defenses that the student/obligee may assert against the assignor/lender. See Jackson v. Culinary School of Washington, 788 F. Supp. 1233, 1248 n.9 ( D.D.C. 1992 ), reversed on other grounds, 27 F.2d 573 ( D.C. Cir. 1994 ), vacated, 515 U.S. 1139, on reconsideration, 59 F.3d 354 ( D.C. Cir. 1995 ). 
Please note that the above citation is applicable to the time period during which college was attended and the alleged loans were made. Accordingly, I request that your client furnishes copies of the following documents : 1 ) Exact copies of the original documents that demonstrate that student loan lending and borrowing transactions did take place and the resulting debt exists.

During the dispute process neither you or your client have been able to show that I received any student loans either directly or indirectly, as tuition support. However, I did receive, Pell Grant and work-study financial aid that covered the cost of my attending College.

2 ) Copies of original documents that meet the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) requirements for legally binding promissory note debt instruments.

The partial, front-end copies of the Application and Promissory Note documents that I filled in and your client has furnished, are financial aid applications. As such, these documents do not contain the following information that is necessary for a document to qualify as a legally binding promissory note : The exact principal amount that has to be paid. The partial copies of the Application and Promissory Note documents that were furnished to me state that the principal can be the amount printed in the loan application, or less, which then also includes XXXX ( {$0.00} ). 
Specific interest rate. 
Due date, and when and at what frequencies any money has to be paid. 
Further, a promissory note must be an unconditional promise to pay. The signed partial copy of the Application and Promissory Note financial aid document on its own is not an unconditional promise to pay, because the financial aid applicant may not receive any loan at all, or may receive the loan in the future at an unknown point in time, in which case the loan amount will be disclosed to the borrower in the Notice of Loan Guarantee and Disclosure Statement. 
That is, the Application and Promissory Note financial aid document does not state with certainty that the financial aid applicant will receive or has received any loan amount at all. If the applicant does not receive any loan amount, then there is no debt or debt obligation. 
Therefore, the Application and Promissory Note financial aid document on its own qualifies at the most as a conditional promise to pay, dependent on the content of the Notice of Loan Guarantee and Disclosure Statement and any other documents that the applicant will sign when receiving a loan. 
Accordingly, as was pointed out above, if your client claims that lending and borrowing transactions occurred, your client must furnish relevant signed documents that amount to legally binding promissory note debt instrument and to unconditional promise to pay.

3 ) Two-sided ( duplex ) exact copies of the two-sided original ( duplex ) Application and Promissory Note documents. 
If your client is the actual legal owner of the alleged debt, then your client must have the original, fully qualifying Promissory Note documents in its possession. So far, your client has furnished copies of the front end of the two-sided Application and Promissory Note documents, and separate copies of what could be the back ends of any persons documents. Nothing links these copies reliably together. There is no information on the separate copies of the back ends that relates them reliably with the front ends of the Application and Promissory Note documents. 
I do not accept the unidentifiable separate back ends as parts of the same documents. Any person who handled these documents could have made a copy of the front end of my financial aid applications, and the back end of another persons financial aid applications, and put them next to each other either accidentally or intentionally, claiming that these two copies belong together as one document.

Similarly, please do not send me two-sided copies that are made from copies. Such copies can be made by putting together two sheets of paper and copying both sides as if it were one document. Such act would be equivalent to forgery. 

Therefore, please have each document notary certified, stating that the document is the exact copy of the original document, not a copy of a copy, and the copy was made in the presence of the notary who certifies it, and which company or organization currently holds the original document. 
Based on the available information, qualifying Promissory Note documents in this case do not exist at all, and your client does not have even the original two-sided ( duplex ) financial aid Application and Promissory Note documents in its possession. Thus, based on the available information, your client has partial copies of irrelevant documents, created internal records and now claims ownership of an alleged debt. 
Without existence of the corresponding lending and borrowing transactions and the relevant documents. Such internal record creating does not create debt. 
I have requested debt validation in this case since XXXX of XXXX. Your client has repeatedly failed to validate that ( 1 ) I received student loans and that any debt actually exists, and ( 2 ) that your client holds valid legally binding promissory note debt instruments, and ( 3 ) that your client is the legal owner of the alleged debt. 
If your client is unable to validate the debt as requested above within 30 days of your receipt of this letter, you and your client must stop making any further monetary demands and state in writing that the Department of Education will not under any circumstances make any further demands regarding the specific previously claimed alleged debt, and will not authorize any individual, company, organization or institution to make any kinds of further demands regarding the specific previously claimed alleged debt.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Nelnet, Inc.",GA,30101,None,Consent provided,Web,06/28/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4494840

Despite multiple attempts, Navient has declined to explain how they initially calculated the past due amount which now stands at XXXX ( I have brought the amount down with continued payments. ) I am also disputing the recent delinquency placed on the loan. I have continued to make payments on the disputed loan amount due. At no point have I stopped making payments. 

I have not been able to get answers to my direct inquiries to Navient. Rather than answer my requests for verification of debt and clarity of how past due amount was calculated, Navient has harassed me with phone calls and other letters with threats of delinquency and credit reporting to maliciously harm me financially. This is reprehensible behavior given my consistent payment record and the recent events ( weather disaster in state/pandemic ) that have so greatly impacted many individuals like myself. 

I have made consistent and accurate payments on my loans yet Navient has sought to exploit the debt owed on this particular private loan. I have made every attempt to pay, but also have the right to verify that what I am being asked to pay is fair and accurate. 

In an attempt to communicate my desire to resolve the issues with this private loan, I responded to a request in XXXX sent concerning settling the loan for an agreed amount. The letter ended up being false and deceptive. Navient did not respond to my attempt to settle the loan via phone. They then placed the loan in delinquency. 

Due to the deceptive, predatory, and hostile customer service of Navient it is nearly impossible to communicate with them directly. Every attempt that I have made to engage with them directly has always resulted in a negative confrontation. My goal is to pay my loan debt off under reasonable and fair terms based on my loan agreements. Navient is a hinderance to this process.

XXXX, IL XXXX XX/XX/2021 XXXX : CFPB Please assist with the below. I have complained multiple times and you are not offering solutions just passing it to the company who is giving me the run around. I need an override and correction and I wont stop till I get it. I'm a customer and I'm right in this instance. Navient the servicer, is giving horrible service and wont validate a debt per my request. They are hiding behind the government and refusing to make me, a customer, whole. This is a debt dispute and its well documented that it should be corrected in my favor. Please help push to override and correction of this from a federal standpoint. THis experience is wrong and intolerable. Thank you for your time and consideration. 



Navient is not giving me what I am asking for. The 2nd paragraph of the attached letter I am clear in what I am asking for. It should have been provided from the first letter. This has become a back and forth with no answers and is a bad customer experience due to the sensitive nature of debt. The servicer has mass marketed approaches that benefit the servicer/federal government and not the borrower. I have attached examples. Navient continues to hid behind acts/statutes with no empathy or apologies. This is still a debt but the only form of debt that you can get away with like this due to federal involvement. I am paying 77K+ as it is not validated and this has been the worst customer experience of my life. Ill do whatever it takes to fight this. Not trying to avoid or discharge but im not paying any debt without clear transparency, what I signed is irrelevant. This is just bad customer service and stressful, no answers. I need to be made whole. My correct loan amount is {$59000.00}. It must be corrected to that solely for this stressful mentally draining experience in addition to avoiding the law and not validating my debt. Please override and correct my balance to {$59000.00}! Look at the paper trail. I cited debt validation and verification. I was given the below. An equation. -- random big charges -- -- no rhyme or reason as why its those dates, gon na randomly do it again???? No one pays a debt that isnt explained to them detail. This company needs to offer more transparency and better customer service. Government should contract with better companies. I'm demanding an override as cited above. Navient refuses to provide detail. They simply dont want to and would rather provide lazy and vague responses. It is a company with technology and resources but sends a few paragraphs and something anyone could have just thrown together. I have a total lack of trust. I cant be expected to believe anything this companies provides after this. Make me whole as stated above. 





This is redundant and repetitive. I am offended honestly. I know who and what Navient is. This is an attempt to shift blame and attention of this matter to the Department of Education. Navient is a business and I am a customer. Total lack of empathy in this response. Very transactional. No new information provided here and nothing that helps/addresses what Ive asked. I already cited that amount in my response. 



Again redundant and transactional I know what interest is and the formula was previously cited. I asked how does this apply specifically to my loan? Im getting repeat information like I lack intelligence. Im offended. Please see your loan agreement for what? What am I supposed to see? Im confused. What details should i be looking for? This letter wants me to apply formulas and see details? This is information Im requesting as a customer its very simple. 



Correct I reviewed the terms and included them in a response. This is a question of transparency. I was vetted in a predatory way to do forboreances and {$0.00} payment plans but it was never explained to me the financial impact of that in detail. Like, the exact amount it would cost me the customer should I take it. Now Im asking, and getting a formula and told to do my own homework. 

The balance owed is {$76000.00}. The {$12000.00} is cited which again I am fully aware of from the previous response. Factoring in the original amount of {$59000.00}, there is still {$4800.00} that isnt explained. How I am expected to have confidence in company that wont fully verify a debt after TWO requests? They are going to continue to minimize themselves and say this is on the government/federal level and do nothing. I am a customer. This is a bill. If you cant provide transparency, there are laws that say I dont have to pay. This is clear they wont do what I ask after multiple attempts. They literally left out {$4800.00}. Twice. See both responses. They came from Navients mouth not mine. Stop flexing Goverment power and fix this. Right a wrong. At minimum this is extremely poor customer service given the gravity of the debt. Its a pandemic. This is a taking a big toll on my mental well being. 




Page 1 of this attempt to clarify things already confusing. {$75000.00} but {$76000.00} is cited in response. Pages 2-5, nothing clarified. No details as requested. Validation should explain how arrived these amounts. But I get it, its Federal. So navient can hide behind that. The US Dept of Edu has the ability to override and correct this and I have full confidence they will. 


Pay a little now, save alot later.Pay what? What specifically to save. All the marketing emails to take {$0.00} payments and forbearances but vague about how amounts get to what they are and what cant tangibly done to reduce them. The verbiage states it may be capitalized which again is confusing. This makes it seem like there is a choice in the matter. I keep getting told what I signed but yet verbiage leaves the door open for a choice to be made by saying may it was misleading then and its misleading now. Theres nothing that specifies how much interest is accruing. That calculation is nowhere to be found and it doesnt show how it applies to my loan. Again, im just supposed to pay whatever Navient sends without transparency? I have to do calculations myself after I ask for this information? No validity to this debt and Navient refuses to provide it. 


Why is date blank????? Keep being told what I agree to and what cant be changed but no details are given So on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXXI was charged over {$12000.00}. Huh? All one day. Whats the rhyme or reason behind this??????? This looks like it was created to lazily just complete a task rather than address a customer concern. It disrespectful to my intelligence. I asked for debt validity. Itemized month by month charges of the whole amount. Explaining how you got to these amounts. I was given 10 pages that conclude with over {$12000.00} being charge on one day..How am I to faith in this in this company regarding a debt I owe? This is insanity. At minimum this is an awful customer service experience. Asking for answers about a large sum of money, to which I am lawfully entitled to. Get vague, poorly put together responses. 


Navient is allowed to give bad customer service and cite whatever they want to requests like mine because they just hide behind the above. I dont even know what the Act is or how it applies to my situation specifically but I know Navient will say they cant do anything because its Federal. But they have a job to do as a company. As noted in my response. They are doing an extremely poor job. 

I am appealing to whatever Federal powers there are at the US Department of Education to make a paying customer whole. Since my debt cant be validated which is the law, I am requesting an override and correction. I know this is possible and im justified for it. My correct loan amount is {$59000.00}. It must be corrected to that solely for this stressful mentally draining experience in addition to avoiding the law and not validating my debt. Please override and correct my balance to {$59000.00}! 

Be advised this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. Under the Fair Debt collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of the debt you say I owe you. I am requesting proof that I am indeed the party you are asking to pay this debt, and there is some contractual obligation that is binding on me to pay this debt. This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the FDCPA. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have or continue to report invalidated information to any of the three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), this action might constitute fraud under both federal and state laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found or continues to report on any of my credit reports by your company or the company you represent, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Defamation of Character. I am sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested in the following declaration, I will require 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with legal counsel for suit. This includes any listing of any information to a credit-reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,60657,None,Consent provided,Web,04/10/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4286324

Additionally, if they aren't subject to the federal rules, then the NELNET loans should have been terminated with my XXXX bankruptcy. I am frustrated and feel they are using tricky methods to try and force a restart of the loan obligation with a "" consolidation '', which I have no interest in doing.

This form was auto generated through StudentAid.gov, and had a number of errors such as stating my EIN was not a government agencyXXXX when it in fact is. This error ultimately was on my part for failing to adequately review the form. 

I resubmitted the ECF on XX/XX/XXXX and it was rejected due to a failure of me to date the form. This error was on my part. 

I resubmitted the ECF on XX/XX/XXXX. The ECF covered approximately 21 payments. I received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite having submitted an ECF beginning XX/XX/XXXX, FedLoan ignored the time period between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and only certified one payment. The other 20 payments remained eligible, but not certified. The explanation that I was provided was that on my XX/XX/XXXX ECF form I used the start date of XX/XX/XXXX rather XX/XX/XXXX, which I put in based on the following instruction from StudentAid.gov PSLF Help Tool : "" Note : Only add your employment history since your last approved employment certification '' No explanation was provided for why the period of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX was ignored On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted another ECF.

One of the documents The income driven repayment history had expired recertification dates and the lender needed updated forms. The form expired XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX est was the time of the first request. I did a three way call with my lender. She explained what she needed the gentleman acted as if he knew what we needed but clearly didnt. The request was to email the forms. That day only two hours later I had the wrong form sent to me. I called and requested the form again XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX EST this time explaining more in detail what I needed. Next morning XX/XX/XXXX I had the email from them this time with no form attachment to it. Called again that night telling them there was no attachment and was told they would resend the form that night. I never received the form. Called again on Friday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST. Requested the form again after having to argue with him that the form I needed did in fact exist and that it was previously sent to me I just needed the updated version. He argued that I didnt need that form but I insisted he just put in the request to have it EMAILED to me. He told me like everyone else it would take 2-4 business days. They had been quick with previous emails so I wasnt worried at this point. By Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX when I had not received the forms I called again and was told by another agent that the gentleman I spoke to on the XXXX only put the request in for mail even though he had documented that I had requested EMAIL and that the request had been closed. She put it yet another request and I was told yet again 2-4 business days but it would likely before the end of the day because they had a light work load.

I initially contacted them, in writing ( see Attachments ), and requested proof ( documents bearing my signature ), that the accounts belonged to me because I have not personally not conducted any business with any of the parties involved in this debt, and know this debt does not belong to me. 
Navient responded to my request for a signature bearing document with a letter ( See attachments ) stating they no longer service the loan and that it was being serviced by another company called Default Services Group. When I contacted the Default Resources group to try and resolve the issue they referred me to a debt collection company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have attempted to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX but as of yet have not received a response. 
Information reported by the 3 major Credit Bureaus in regards to the accounts on my credit file vary greatly from one agency to the next and makes it very difficult to trust the validity and accuracy of the information provided by the Dept. of Ed/Navient, and the three credit reporting agencies. ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) Case in point my credit reports from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX shows the payment history of the Dept. of Ed/Navient accounts going from being OK to being 90 days late from XXXX. This is also the period of time where the account was being handled by a Default Services Group ( since XXXX ), and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was no longer being serviced by Dept. of Ed/Navient ( see Attachments ). Also the dates and amounts reported to the 3 Credit Bureaus vary depending on which agency is reporting. 
This serves as proof the information being reported on my credit report is not accurate nor is being properly verified and the law is very clear on this matter and states that information reported on a credit report MUST be ACCURATE. In this case the information is not. Yet these unverified accounts remain on my credit report in violation of both the FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ). 
All of these discrepancies serve as proof the information being reported on my credit report is not accurate, nor is it being properly verified by in accordance with the law and needs to be removed.

07/18/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have argued numerous times that XXXX/Sallie Mae Tuition Answer loan was discharged as part of my 2017 chapter XXXX bankruptcy ( see attached ). They have collected monthly payments since then as part of the charge off, they have been reporting my account as late each month since then to the various credit agencies even though Ive been paying their agreed upon monthly payments. As per a number of recent cases, it has been determined that in fact the Tuition Answer loans were dischargeable. 

The rulings state ( excerpt summary ) : The sole question is whether the student loans constitute an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, since Navient didnt argue that the student loan fell in either the first or third categories. 

The court embarked on an analysis of stautory interpretation of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to determine the underlying meaning of the operative words in the text. 

The term educational benefit is undefined and potentially vague. The court concluded that the terms should be interpreted in light of its listed companions, suggesting educational benefits means conditional grant payments similar to scholarships and stipends. Since scholarships and stipends generally dont have to be repaid, the plaintiff in this case isnt required to pay these private student loans. 

FURTHER, the below was mentioned : Sallie Mae XXXX XXXX loans are considered non-qualified student loans, which means they are eligible to be XXXX through a bankruptcy. These loans are above the cost of attendance to help students have money to live on while they go to school. 

If you have a Tuition Answer student loan discharged in bankruptcy, but Sallie Mae or its representatives attempt to collect on these same loans after the bankruptcy, those collection attempts could be in violation of federal bankruptcy laws. 

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) prevents lenders and debt collectors from trying to collect on debts that have been discharged in a bankruptcy.

If you have had a Tuition Answer Student Loan discharged in a bankruptcy, but the debtor or its representatives continue to try to collect that money from you, you could be deserving of compensation for violations of the FDCPA. 

When you file bankruptcy, you are protected by law from the borrowers of the loans that have been discharged. They can not make future attempts to collect on debts that have been discharged. Lenders and debt collectors can be held liable for willful violations of the bankruptcy discharge order if they continue to harass you to collect payment.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,SLM CORPORATION,NY,10505,None,Consent provided,Web,07/29/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4552937

07/22/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I had a student loan with Sallie Mae for many years and it eventually became Navient. I have had intermittent issues with them over the years regarding not posting payments. They can't seem to process money orders. I have no choice but to send money orders each month. I have a consolidated loan with my ex-husband and he is court ordered to send me money orders once a year ( 12 of them ) and I have to send them monthly to satisfy his portion of our loan. ( I actually pay my half online ). Every month for the last ( probably 6 ) months, I get harassing calls from Navient about my payment not being made. They tell me they never received the money orders. Then I have to call the money order company and confirm they were cashed-which they always are. Then Navient will argue with me and tell me I have to send them proof from the company ( which the company charges {$30.00} for. An automated system will give you the cleared date for free but charge for official copies ), and it's a written mailed request I have to send in, wait for it to be sent back, and then I would have to send it to Navient. The whole process is very time consuming all the while they are showing me past due. Every month I have to explain to a different Navient employee what is going on and that it happens every month. Today is the 2nd time this week they have called me-while I'm working. My payment is due the 11th. I mailed it 2 weeks ago, they cashed it on the XXXX of this month. Yet, they have no record of it in their system. THIS IS THE MOST FRUSTERING THING I HAVE EVER HAD TO DO REPETITIVELY regarding a billing issue and i do not wish ( or feel like I should have to ) do this for the remaining 15 years (? ) of my loan. There have been times they called XXXX weeks after they cashed it to tell me I am past due. 

The money order is mailed with a printout of my account ( I don't get a monthly statement ). The printout has the money order number on it, the amount of the payment, my loan number, name, address, and i put a note on it that says "" any questions call XXXX ''. The money order has the loan number on it. A few months ago a Navient employee said "" put a XXXX after the account number on the money order. It will help it get processed. '' So I did that. The following month when they called and I explained, the employee said "" Since you are sending in 2 money orders, put them in different envelopes ( still with -9 ). So I do that, both will the printouts and all the information. ( I take a picture with my phone every month of the paperwork and the money order so I have documentation ) It's like a big game to them. They have called me 2 times today already. My anxiety and stress about this is through the roof and they don't care and they have no answers, and they don't care to make any process improvements. Why wouldn't a money order get posted when it is received like a check does? A money order is more reliable, its been prepaid. A check could bounce? 

I know Sallie Mae has had lawsuits for mishandling payments and other issues. I don't want a law suit. All I want from them is to process my payments and stop harassing me and acting like I don't pay my debts. I don't want to have to spend an hour on the phone with them once or twice a month every month explaining their incompetence. I think they should be forced into a process improvement, or fined if a payment is received but not posted within ( 3 days seems plenty reasonable ). The employee today told me it takes 3 days, yet it is the XXXX and it was cashed on the XXXX? He didn't really have any explanation, they never do. 15 minutes after I got off the phone with Navient, I got another call from them about my payment being late?! I have ask them to stop calling me about payments and told them why but they said no, they can't do that. I'm pretty sure you can ask a creditor to stop calling??

We have met every single demand they have given us ( demands that change each time ) in order to allocate our payments as we indicate, however they never honor their promise.

When I explained to her what has been going on, she said I sound misinformed. She was yelling at me, talking over me and clearly incapable of handling the problem, not only due to her role, but also due to her inability to listen to the problem and remain professional.

I am distraught because there seems to be no recourse and no accountability. My mental health is suffering due to Navient 's abusive practices. My work day is getting interrupted by their constant phone calls. I am losing sleep, having XXXX  and XXXX due to this issue. I am a person, Navient is a huge corporation.

8. In XX/XX/XXXX, I created an account with Fedloan Servicing, and requested that my payment history from XXXX to XXXX to be sent to Fedloan Servicing from XXXXl for the purposes of PSLF. 
9. Under Fedloan Servicing, I continued to make timely payments under Income Based repayment plans via electronic funds transfer. 
10. To date, Fedloan Servicing considers every payment made with other loan servicers from XXXX to XXXX ineligible for PSLF, detailing that I was either not billed, or the payment was received outside the payment window. 
11. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested that Fedloan conduct a payment count of all prior payments I had made from XXXX to XXXX to review the determination that those payments were ineligible for PSLF. 
12. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Fedloan has advised me that that request remains open and not yet completed.

14.

It is to my knowledge that Navient/ US Department of Education has formed an alleged debt in the form of a loan in fraudulence using my personal open ended consumer credit plan and personal consumer credit card ( SSN ). The Truth in Lending Act does not define the word loan or borrower therefore I do not know how this alleged debt can be validated in truth. It seems that This notion has also made Navient/US Department of Education the Debtor, borrower and a debt collector of the alleged debt, As they Have not produced any original instrument proving to be the original creditor. The misrepresentation of Navient/US Department of Education as the Original Creditor constitutes consumer fraud and I demand validity in this matter, that the above account be deemed Closed and blocked from reentering my consumer report.

( h ) The term credit sale refers to any sale in which the seller is a creditor. The term includes any contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the property and services involved and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee will become, or for no other or a nominal consideration has the option to become, the owner of the property upon full compliance with his obligations under the contract.

The agent simply stated that you can afford to make the payments of {$220.00} per month based on the financial information provided to Sallie Mae. I can not even pay rent for housing at this point. There is an arrears of rent at this point, yet Sallie Mae claims that I don't financially qualify for my loans to be remodified.

08/06/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"Two years ago Navient placed me on a plan that Id have to renew every six months with step rate payments. I started off paying around {$180.00} a month and most recently my payments were up to {$240.00} per month. The program allows you to slowly work your way back to the full payment amount which is {$330.00} for my student loan. When I extended the lower payment program in XXXX they advised me to call back after my XX/XX/2021 payment if I still needed the assistance, which I do. I called them today XX/XX/2021 around XXXX and initially spoke to an employee named XXXX who asked me the number of people in my household and my salary, after providing it to her she advised there were no options for me. I asked to be transferred and instead I was hung up on. I called back, XXXX answered once again and this time she transferred me to XXXX employee ID XXXX. I went through my financials advised her my salary is {$3600.00} a month, my expenses are right around {$3600.00} a month, and I have a four person household of which two are my dependents. I only provided her my portion of the bills because my husband takes care of anything I can not afford. I advised her that I could still pay the {$240.00} or even a slight increase to {$260.00} but she stated there are no options available to me and its Lender discretion as to whether they provide you options or not, which to me sounds like they are ELECTING to not help me any further. For two years Ive made payments on time and Ive kept my promise. The lender clearly advised the lower payment options would be available until I made my way to the actual payment amount of {$330.00} and based on my calculations I should have at least 2 more years of lower payments available until I reach the full amount. I have ensured payments were made during covid even though all other student loan companies allowed for deferments Navient would not, and now theyre not even willing to assist a borrower who is trying to do the right thing and is asking for assistance. I would like my loan and case reviewed because Ive been faced with a lot of abusive practices from Navient over the years and I havent complained. Ive received threatening calls and emails, impacts to my credit report even when Ive tried to work with them and now Im facing another issue because I cant pay the full amount, my credit will be impacted again even if I remain paying the lower amount. At this juncture I have no options but to file a complaint with the CFPB. They have at minimum violated the following regulations UDAAP, Fair Lending, and FDCPA and I need someone to look further into my case.

04/02/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have 3 student loans with Sallie Mae and they are mishandling all of my information and payments. I can not afford the absurdly high payments they are requesting due to being unemployed and having an incredible amount of difficulty finding a job. On XXXX XXXX Sallie Mae and myself reached an agreement for a reduced payment plan for the amount of {$510.00} every month, which is a HUGE amount considering my income is XXXX. On the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX the amount of {$510.00} Was withdrawn from my personal checking account. I made the three qualifying payments for this payment reduction plan and they negated it. Sallie Mae and their inability to realize they entered a contract with me by withdrawing the agreed upon amount on 3 separate occasions, decided those payments didnt count for anything and Sallie Mae proceeded to put me in delinquency as well as my co-signer and caused both of us to have our credit negatively impacted. Sallie Mae claimed I was denied for the reduced payment plan on XX/XX/XXXX and said our agreement was void. I submitted a complaint to CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX and Sallie Mae responded admitting fault in the sense that they never communicated with me that we, my co-signer and I, were denied the reduced payment plan and still proceeded with withdrawals. I tried to talk to Sallie Maes Office of the Customer Advocate, but the employee would not let me record his voice so I had concrete evidence of an agreement. That went nowhere, but Sallie Mae decided to enroll me in a plan I DID NOT agree too on XX/XX/XXXX and completed a withdrawal of {$510.00} on XXXX XXXXthat was NOT authorized or agreed upon. So essentially, Sallie Mae stole {$510.00} from me. They are now attempting to withdraw XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This is way too high of a payment and I would not have agreed to this enormous amount. The agreement that granted Sallie Mae access to my checking account was for the amount {$510.00}, and they themselves said that agreement was void or negated on XX/XX/XXXX. They no longer had my permission to withdraw any money from that account, but proceeded to do so anyways and now come XXXX XXXX they are going to steal {$730.00} from me. If I didnt qualify for the payment reduction program, then Sallie Mae should have NEVER accessed my personal checking account and ESPECIALLY should not have made any further withdrawals after XX/XX/XXXX because I never gave written or oral consent for them to withdraw anything other than the agreed upon amount on XX/XX/XXXX. Sallie Mae as accessed my personal checking account illegally. I NEVER talked to Sallie Mae and agreed on their new version of the payment reduction plan and there is no agreement anywhere, in writing, electronically, orally, or otherwise. I know I owe student loans to Sallie Mae, but I am having a very hard time doing business with this shady lender.

AES is deflecting their criminal actions by trying to blame the consumer for their negligent behavior. These people who respond to these CFPB complaints are not doing their jobs or investigating anything properly. They are simply speaking to their superiors who are probably embezzling funds or are involved in some sort of drug operation which is meant to bankrupt the average everyday taxpaying American. When the company can not even admit that recording phone calls in Pennsylvania without the other party 's consent is against the law, the period of denial is now pathological deceit. 

If AES can not follow the Wiretapping Laws in Pennsylvania, then AES will likely end up paying a district court for willingly breaking the law for failing to obtain the necessary preparatory technology to not record consumers when they have already made several demands for them to not record the calls. Recording Phone calls in Pennsylvania without two-party consent is illegal. AES is being put on notice to cease and desist with all recordings for any future calls I may make to AES. Failure to do so will create more evidence that may be brought against AES for being negligent in abiding by the Pennsylvania Wiretapping Law. 

CFPB Complaints will be consistently made until AES can rectify their unforgiveable behavior and offensive degradation of duty. These will also be used as pieces of evidence which are currently being built against AES to prove to the judicial auspices that corrupt individuals can still be found employed at AES and within the board of those financial overseeing companies.

Exhibits were attached in the form of my actual credit report. I am hoping to receive a reply but in the interim I am filing a complaint ; as my rights have been violated. I am also looking for monetary compensation in the amount of {$5000.00} for the distress it has caused both myself and my family for 5 FEDERALLY PROTECTED CONSUMER RIGHTS VIOLATIONS UNDER 15 USC 1681 & 1692 and this retribution is minute in comparison to many other violations that could be claimed under this section. 

Please see below explanations. 1. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act sect
ion 15 USC 1692e I as a consumer have the right to not be violated by the communicating of any credit information that is known or should be known to be false. There is no proof nor validation of this debt. Therefore, it SHOULD be known to be false in accordance with the above. In addition, I have never been presented with any affidavit that would provide validity to neither you nor the alleged debt collectors assessment.

2. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act section 15 USC 1692e the said debt coll
ector must not use any false nor deceptive/misleading representation. This includes but is not limited to the use of any business, company, or organization name other than the TRUE NAME of the debt collectors business, company or organization. None of the alleged debts have been validated nor rep
resented by the original creditor. Per EQUIFAX reports, there were 5 sold accounts. If these alleged debts were indeed soldWhere is the proof of the alleged debtors approval? This too is a violation of consumer rights pursuant to 15 USC 1692d ( 4 ).

3. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act I as a consumer have the right to privacy and my privacy has been breached. According to my credit report, there has been alleged de
bts published without my permission ; using my name and personal information by which to do.

4. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act section 15 USC 1692d I as a consumer have the right to not be harassed, oppressed or abused in connection to any alleged debt. The publishing of this false information has done all of such. It has prevented me as a natural person from my rights to attain both material and physical comforts in order to safely and effectively support myself and my family. It has caused abuse by-way-of embarrassment due to the constant declination I have faced when trying to pursue this said right. It has sabotaged both my name and my creditability.

5. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681a ( 2 ) ( b ) any authorization or approval of a specific
extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device should be excluded from a consumer report. The definition of a credit card pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( l ) is any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining, money, property, labor, or services on credit. Hence, my social security card. In fact, my social security card with its attached number would have had to be used to transact any of the alleged debts listed. Therefore, pursuant to the above, this is a violation of my rights as a federally protected consumer.",None,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MI,48047,None,Consent provided,Web,08/05/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4605123

Note, both organizations had been previously approved for PSLF eligibility. I just wanted to fill in the gaps to reflect my qualifying payments. I submitted the forms on XX/XX/21 for both organizations, unfortunately I used a electronic signature ( my fault ). On XX/XX/21 I received letters stating there were errors on my applications. I contacted FedLoan to see how I could correct the issue. I was told I needed to write a note with my signature and submit it. I did on XX/XX/21. However, afterwards, I got a feeling those directions were incorrect. I was finally able to speak with a specialist who said that a handwritten note is not acceptable and "" FedLoan employees need to stop telling people to do that ''. I made the corrections ( signature ) and resubmitted the certification forms on XX/XX/21. In addition, the letters I received said that my previous and current employers needed to contact FedLoan for further verification. HR representations from both organizations called, and each told me that FedLoan really didn't understand why they were calling and I am the one that needs to take action. So, their time was wasted ( not happy ). Time went by and I reached out to Fedloan since I didn't hear anything. I was told the applications were still under review and needed additional time to process. The next month I reached out and I found out one of the applications was NEVER forwarded for review. I made sure that application process was initiated. For the other application, I was told employer eligibility was under review and needed time to process. Thankfully, the certification for qualifying payments with the previous employer was approved. I reached back out again to check on my current employers application to find out I am supposed to use a PSLF Help Tool? So I go to studentaid.gov and use the Help Tool and it generates a form to submit ... THE SAME FORM I SUBMITED IN XXXX! In addition, with the pandemic and loans being in forbearance..

I held my loans in forbearance during this time. There is a special arrangement with XXXX volunteers who seek to apply for the PSLF program where after the XXXX service contract ends, a retroactive calculation can be made for what the monthly payments would have been over the XXXX service period, once the loans were out of grace period ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX. XXXX ). Based on this calculation, the XXXX volunteer can make those payments retroactively, using their Segal Education Award, and have those payments count as qualifying payments toward their PSLF ( even though it was in forbearance originally ). I went through this process and was told that my qualifying monthly payments would be $ XXXXmonth over the XXXX service and submitted an employment verification form at that time ( late XXXX ). There was an issue with the EIN. I moved abroad over this period and was unable to resolve the issue myself. I had my mother ( who had financial power of attorney at the time ) contact Fedloan about this issue. They would not recognize the notarized POA document provided and the issue went unresolved ( they did not approve the form since it was incomplete and therefore the PSLF payments were not accepted ). Once I returned from abroad ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I brought back the issue, and tried submitting the EIN to get the payments approved. I was told that it could not be approved because the 90 period had passed for the employment verification form and that it was a void document. They recommended I resubmit a new employment verification form. When I did so, they said that the employment qualified, but the payments did not. COntrary to the information I was provided in XXXX, they told me that they had to recalculate the payments based on a standard repayment plan and not the income driven repayment plan originally used to calculate my monthly payments. As such, they provided me with a recalculated repayment total over the span of XXXX XXXX - XXXX. XXXX ( totalling {$2200.00} ). I then made this payment using my Segal award, on the information that this would result in the approval of my qualifying payments over that period of time. I received my updated qualifying payments toward the PSLF after this time, but the payment was not recognized. I submitted a review of the qualifying payments on XX/XX/XXXX and have yet to hear back regarding this issue. To date, I have been trying to resolve this issue for three and a half years, my legal POA was denied access and ability to manage my financial affairs, information regarding my qualifying PSLF payments has changed, I was coerced into paying {$2200.00} out of my Segal award with not results ( in contradiction to previous information provided from Fedloan ), have spent countless hours on the phone trying to resolve this issue, and have no information on a timeline of when the present review will be determined.",None,AES/PHEAA,WI,54017,None,Consent provided,Web,01/22/21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4086227

I am the parent of a student that attended XXXX XXXX out of state ) I was forced/extorted in to co-signing a loan in 2008 so my son could continue his studies. The Original loan Amount {$4900.00} - they skim off the top $ XXXX leaving {$4200.00} for the student. As the cosigner i have been making payments for years. Currently as of XXXX statement, I have paid a total of {$4200.00} to VSAC ... .. and the outstanding balance is still @ {$3500.00}. If i were able to pay this amount today- I will have paid @ {$7700.00}. to pay back a net loan of {$4200.00}. So the criminal XXXX will profit {$750.00} + {$3400.00} = {$4200.00} on a {$4200.00} loan. This is beyond criminal maybe you can address this.

01/26/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I went to graduate school in the XXXX. Made my first payment to then Sallie Mae in XXXX. Have since paid off {$41000.00} of a {$34000.00} student loan. As of this writing, mostly due to capitalized interest my principal amount is {$38000.00}. My estimated total payment is {$100000.00}. In XXXX I had my principal amount down to {$19000.00}, because I had paid ahead, my next payment due was not until XX/XX/XXXX. I was on track and in striking distance of getting out from under this debt. I started a XXXX XXXX in XXXX. A year later my XXXX second-hand car broke beyond repair, so I got a brand-new-second-hand XXXX. Then came the Great Recession shortly thereafter. I was able to keep my fledgling business, by restructuring and was able to pay off my SBA backed loan not only on time ( balloon payment ), but without missing a single payment. I was also able to keep paying on my 5-year, $ XXXX/month car loan, again without missing a payment. It wasnt until I purchased this car that I became aware that credit scores stopped at XXXX, never gave it a thought, just always lived below my means and paid my bill on time. The finance guy, at the dealership, brought it to my attention. He told me that in all his years of working in the industry, he never met someone with an XXXX credit score. I was like, XXXX out of XXXX? He was like, no, XXXX out of XXXX. That was then. Thanks to Navient. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, two months before my next student loan payment was due, given the state of the economy and my current situation, I reached out to servicer inquiring as to what options were available to me. The answer came back file for Economic Hardship. So I did, only to get a reply stating that I had filed too earlier. It was XXXX and my next payment was not due until XXXX. According to them. I needed to file within 30 days of the date my next payment was due, which as I stated above was XX/XX/XXXX. Even though I was not delinquent at the time, I was sent a letter asking me to choose the date in the future when I wanted the economic hardship to apply and/or initial a specific spot in the letter for delinquent loan. These two options were in the same letter. Looking back I now suspect I was being set up to go into delinquency, I just didnt realize it at the time. And this is how my delinquency, administrative forbearance, late fees and capitalized interest journey started, and continues. 

Even though I complied with the request in the letter, the rest of XXXX, was a struggle to get to some definitive plan. As the months ticked by, I started getting past due notifications, then threating to report me to the various credit agencies notifications, and finally the threat of default. It was at this point that XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) got involved. It wasnt until XXXX made me aware of an Income Sensitive Repayment Plan, that I realize such an option existed. When I finally made it on to this Plan in XX/XX/XXXX, my servicer had racked up late fees, capitalized interest, and anything else they could tack on to my loan amount. 
Ive been on this plan since then, however, every time Im in receipt of correspondence from Navient, the letters always state somewhere in there, Capitalized interest may apply. That should read Capitalized interest will most definitely apply, because I have never been shown any leniency when it came to tacking that on. And they have never given any example of when it may or may not be applied. It has come to my attention that while on the Plan, now refer to as Income Based Repayment, no interest should be capitalized. However, Ive recently noticed that in XXXX and XXXX capitalized interest in the amount of {$5300.00} and {$5900.00} were applied, respectively. I have maintained my IBR eligibility and status since XXXX. So there is a bit on contradiction there. Ive recently gotten my latest recertification letter a month behind schedule and had some concerns. Through the Ombudsmans office I was able to finally reach someone at Navient located within the boarder of the 50 States, but just like XXXX, I am getting nowhere. I do plan to contact HESC directly and see if they can also assist. Im just looking to get Navinet to communicate with me. I would add in a timely manner, but this late point, its not applicable. 

Steering me to file Economic Hardship when Income Sensitive Repayment was a much better option, not getting back to borrowers with time sensitive issues so the clock can tick and in turn rack up late fee and the likes is willful, predatory and unforgivable..",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,14850,None,Consent provided,Web,01/26/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4095035

04/20/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have been having issues with Navient ( Federal Student Loan Servicer ). Navient sent me a letter stating that my student loans didn't have to be repaid when I thought that I was supposed to be out of the grace period. I never received any information from the loan servicer regarding when I was to start my repayments or what options I would have to repay my loans. I did not find out that I had 42 late payment entries until later on when happened to decide to go back to school. I was informed that my student loans were in default and I was told to go on a forbearance to bring my account current. I also asked them if there was anyway due to in miscommunication on their part to remove the derogatory marks from my credit report. They told me I had to send in a letter. I sent in a letter and they said that it was going to be 30 days before I get a response. I also asked them if there was anyway to get my loans. I was still debating on going back to school and on a separate occasion, I asked them if there was anything that I could do to stay current since I was unemployed and didn't have a job. They finally told me about the repayment plan where I wouldn't have to pay anything as long as I didn't have any income. I asked that person how long that had been around for and he said for a couple of years. Navient did not send me any notification stating that payments were to began getting paid as they claimed that they did in 2017. I never did receive a response from the Navient regarding the letter that I sent. This issue has been a huge problem since 2017 and I have not had a problem since then. It took me a while to educate myself on this since Navient failed to disclose this information in an attempt to keep from being exposed to additional issues that they were facing similar to mine. I have again asked that they remove the derogatory marks from my Credit Report and they refuse as they say that they reported correctly. I don't believe they report correctly and if that was the case, they should report being late after 30 days instead of 90 days in which they claimed to have contacted me when I received no such correspondence. If they go to the extent of waiting 90 days before reporting things on people 's reports, then they should have sent me a certified letter, in which I received no such letter advising me of my delinquency and failure to contact would result each and ever separate loan being reported as past due, which has practically killed my credit report. Navient failed to advise me of the correct payment beginning date and the ending of any and all deferments for any reason, failed to accurately report correct information to the credit bureaus, failed to advise me on repayment plans available to me while I was unemployed so that I didn't have to be put in forbearance and risk the same problem again. Navient has also failed to remove the derogatory remarks due to their failure off of my credit report. This is not the first issue with Navient and they just had to settle lawsuits on the same types of behaviors. Navient has chosen to ignore me until I brought my complaint to the U.S. Department of Education. The compliant process was supposed to go to a third party ombudsman, who was supposed to be neutral, but instead was sent to an individual that worked for Navient. There was nothing unbiased on that process and they took the same position as the Loan Servicer. I would like this complaint to be investigated and if Navient fails to do the right thing, I will unfortunately have to file a lawsuit against Navient for the same allegations as it was sued for previously for their practices while servicing my loan. This behavior is unacceptable this started around 2016-2017 when all of this behavior was alleged in other lawsuits to have been going on, and that is to include inaccurately reporting and deceiving borrowers in order to get additional fees and for other reasons. Please see if you can resolve this issue prior to me being forced to file a suit against Navient.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",LA,70461,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4315043

( Original total was {$30000.00} ; the loans were paid {$15000.00} and consolidated. See attached screenshot from Navient site ) After that I made payments, over many years. Throughout that time I attempted to lower my payments so that I could make them, but was consistently talked into a forbearance, which has only increased the amount of a loan significantly. 
2. In XXXX, I made a payment of {$8000.00} to my loan total which was about {$15000.00}. Today when I look at the total on the Navient site, it has gone back up to {$17000.00}. I was never informed that interest was going to accrue over the subsequent 3 three years or that the payment wasn't going to cut the balance in half. 
3. See attached screenshot. Just in the past month my balance has increased by {$100.00}. For what reason? 
4. I am a XX/XX/XXXX, I've never brought home more than XXXX a year. I XX/XX/XXXX in a private school, so I am not eligible for any kind of loan forgiveness. However, approximately XXXX of the original XXXX has been paid since the loans were dispersed in XXXX and in XXXX, but now I am being taken advantage of by a for-profit institution that incentivizes students going into forbearances.

The loan was then transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX fulfilled the drop in interest rate to 4.125 % after 24 consecutive months of timely payments resulting in monthly payments of {$350.00}. I qualified for an economic hardship forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, at which time XXXX raised my interest rate to 4.375 %. I paid interest payments only during that time. At the end of the forbearance, XXXX sent a bill for {$2600.00} in remaining interest, which I paid in full. I then signed up for EZ pay automatic student loan payments, which dropped my interest rate back down to 4.125 %. The loan suddenly increased by over {$5000.00} and the payments then increased to {$520.00} per month. I paid {$100.00} to principal on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which were credited properly. I received a 1 % drop in interest rate after 36 consecutive timely payments, dropping my interest rate to 3.125 % and payments to {$450.00} per month. Sallie Mae took over my loans around XXXX and changed names to Navient in XXXX. Auto-debit was set up with Navient and payments of {$450.00} were taken from my account on the first of each month. Despite paying this loan consistently on the 1st of each month, as an automatic withdrawal, extra payments sent were applied to interest and principal both or only to interest. I recently called Navient to have them explain this to me and they told me this was happening because I had outstanding interest charges. I asked how this could possibly happen with consistent on-time payments and the rep could not explain it to me. She did say that if I paid the outstanding {$15.00} in interest, that all future extra payments would be applied to principal. I paid the {$15.00} that same day by having the rep complete a bank draft on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an extra payment sent in with a letter asking that it be applied to principal only and the payment was applied to both interest and principal despite my express request. I am not sure what is going on with Navient, but there is something that just isn't right. I have made over {$4500.00} in extra payments since XXXX and none of them have been applied to principal only. I also think there were some extra funds erroneously applied to my loan by XXXX after the forbearance. I would appreciate some help in evaluating what is happening with this loan and why I keep incurring interest fees despite consistently timely payments.

A couple more years pass and I work my credit score up to the mid-700s and applied again. Surprise surprise now I don't have a long enough credit history according to Navient. The reasons given were a ) a previous loan default ( which I am completely unaware of somehow ) b ) delinquent payments ( for federal student loans which are now many years removed from present day ) and c ) amount on accounts is too high ( I can't imagine the {$14000.00} I still owe them and am paying for is very much compared to many ). 

I've tried everything to meet the arbitrary standards to release my co-signer from my loan. I've made on-time payments every month for years and years and it's still not good enough.

However, this year I've had issues with Fedloan Servicing ( my current loan servicer ) accepting my PSLF form. I have submitted this form 4 times now and each time I receive a response that I am missing information of some type despite have the correct information on the form. Every time I talk with customer service they also insist if I resubmit my form again any issue will be corrected. I have resubmitted my form four times now and the issue is still not resolved and the issue continues to change each time despite me not changing any information. I first submitted my PSLF re-cert on XX/XX/2021 and received an email that my signature was invalid. It was an electronic PIV signature that I've previously used in past years without issue. Myself and my supervisor resigned with a digital signature ( drawn digitally ) and resubmitted. On XX/XX/2021 I received a notification that my signature was once again invalid and my employer did not fill out section 4 of the form for non-government employees ( which is incorrect ; section 4 was not needed since I was a federal employee and it was clearly marked that I was and the form instructs you to skip section 4 if you are ). I called Fedloan about the form and they said that the digital signature needed to be a "" wet signature '' and that the section 4 error was a mistake and to ignore.

I asked why the change in not accepting digital signatures as they have accepted them in the past and that we were also in a pandemic so getting a "" wet signature '' was near impossible since we are all working remotely.

08/02/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I contacted FedLoan to inquire about the # of qualifying payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. The tracker in my account shows 56 qualifying payments and 64 to go for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and 55 qualifying payments and 65 to go for the Direct Subsidized Loan. The log showing which payments do not qualify list at least 68 payments for both the unsubsidized and subsidized loans as "" Your Payment was Received Outside of Payment Period Window. '' This does not make sense as I was always enrolled in automatic payments and the payments were automatically withdrawn by whatever lender was servicing my loan.

I contacted FedLoan via chat on XX/XX/XXXX inquiring about this and was told by the agent that "" the date that [ they ] can see a payment was made looks to be correct. So, it may be a system error. Sorry for the confusion. '' I asked if I should provide my bank statements to show that my payments were made INSIDE the payment window and they advised "" to wait for the review to complete. '' This is not the first time I contacted FedLoan about the # of qualifying payments. 
*************** I then sent the following email to FedLoan on XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email asking about the # of qualifying payments attributed to my account as at the time, my account showed 42 qualifying payments for the direct unsubsidized loan and 32 for the direct subsidized. I followed-up on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and both times was told that I would be contacted as soon as a review was complete. Although I was never contacted, I have continued to check my account to see if it's been updated. Now, I have 55 qualifying payments and 72 payments are deemed ineligible because "" no payment was received in payment period. '' However, this is incorrect as I was set up for automatic payments, and I have bank records to show that payments were INDEED made on time each month. Please advise how I can submit my bank records to show that these 72 payments do actually qualify. Thank you. 
*************** I received this response on XX/XX/XXXX : Thank you for contacting FedLoan Servicing!

According to my records, I should be able to formally file for forgiveness around XXXX of XXXX. However, according to my online account, I have 17 ineligible payments.

I have been trying to rectify the payment count for about 3-4 years. When I initially called, I was told that they were backlogged and were prioritizing accounts nearer to the 120 count but they will have my account manually reviewed. I've called every 6 to 8 months to see if any progress was made and received the same response. 

They made an update to their website where you can see which payments qualified, which did not and why. Even though they were all made under the qualified payment plan and payments were made on time, most of them were listed as being "" Outside the Window ''. I noticed that all of the ineligible payments were when my accounts were with a different servicer ( XXXX  XXXX  ). Some of my payments from that time period went through but most of them did not and I can not get an explanation as to why. 

I called a couple of times in XXXX to find out when my account will be reviewed and I got the same response of being backlogged and to call back in a few months. I called again in XX/XX/XXXX and I got the same response even though I should be eligible for loan forgiveness soon.

I have been paying XXXX every month since then. I have been employed with the XXXX since XXXX and continued to pay on my loan even though I knew of the Student Loan Forgiveness Program. My logic was- its my debt and Ill pay it until I am no longer able. Which in my mind was when my finances decrease, meaning when I retire. Now that I have 30 years with the XXXX, retirement is my next step. So I completed the paperwork in XXXX for the Forgiveness Program. The first response I received was that I did not qualify. 
I went back and did some research and applied again in XXXX and received the response that I was not employed with an eligible organization. 
So, I dug a little deeper and called to speak with someone at the organization that holds the loan, Navient. I was told that I did not have the type of loans that were eligible for the Forgiveness Program. This is where the problem begins. 
XXXX had the loan when I graduated and I made sure that I consolidated my loans to the type that were eligible for the Program since I was already employed by XXXX. Next, the loan was sold to Sally Mae and they were still consolidated to be eligible for the Program. From Sally Mae they were sold to Navient and suddenly they are not eligible for the Program. I was told by Navient that I could consolidate them now but the 120 required payments, or 10 years worth of payments would have to start over. I am getting ready to retire and will not be able to afford another 10 years of payments when I have already made XXXX payments! The absurdity is that I owe {$84000.00} and the loan was for {$82000.00}! I have paid off a home and two vehicles since I got the loan and after paying on it for 16 years ... I now owe more than the initial loan in XXXX. I have paid more than the required 120 payments necessary to qualify for the Forgiveness Program and feel that Navient is trying to get more money from me because I have been paying consistently. I need your help because even the current pandemic inspired relief on student loan payments does not apply to loans that are not held by the Department of Education and I am still making monthly payments as of today. I am requesting your assistance to check into this situation and see if my loan can be forgiven since Ive already met the 120 payments required of the Forgiveness Program.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MO,64114,None,Consent provided,Web,03/23/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4237008

I set up a loan rehabilitation payment and I dealt with XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX - I sent in all requested documents and set up a payment plan of {$200.00} that was deducted automatically from my account. ( You can see these payments in my Account History on my current XXXX account ). On XX/XX/XXXX - payments were stopped. I had assumed that it was because I completed the program. I never received any correspondence, written or otherwise updating me. I then spoke with XXXX XXXX from XXXX, who then advised me that although I made payments, they did not count toward the rehabilitation program since they never received all of my documents. No one ever advised me that they did not receive them as I had faxed them ( with confirmation of fax ). XXXX advised that I would then have to restart the program. I reluctantly agreed due to not having a choice. I completed all of the paperwork again and faxed it - payments of {$450.00} were set up to be automatically taken out starting in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX These payments are confirmed in XXXX Account History ). In XX/XX/XXXX, Covid happened and I tried to see where my loans were in the process as the 9 months were complete in XXXX. Again, I had received NO correspondence from XXXX regarding my loans. I knew that all student loan payments were suspended until XXXX, but I had no idea where to look to see who was servicing my loans as it was no longer XXXX. I even searched the Federal Student Aid Website. I sent an email via their website to XXXX to see if they had it and received a typical response that they couldn't tell me if I had. Fast forward to XXXX I finally figured out that XXXX was in fact servicing my loans and they first told me they had "" no idea who XXXX is '' then advised after some digging that the knew they were a collection agency and had not been servicing my loan since XX/XX/XXXX. I was then able to see in my XXXX account history that there was a "" payment reversal '' for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any correspondence as to why, nor could anyone from XXXX tell me why. Upon looking into my bank statements, the payments were never taken out of my account those 3 months - again, no letter/phone call stating why. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX of XXXX and was told that she would push it ( my account ) to be completed as I had made all of the payments. She advised me to call back in a week as that is when it should be updated in the system. When this is updated it should not be showing XXXX XXXX any longer. I have occasionally checked the system and it wasn't completed. So I called again today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke with XXXX who informed me that that was NOT TRUE and I had to go through the loan rehab program AGAIN! This is unacceptable and you can clearly see on my account history that payments were made. XXXX was a horrible loan servicer that I had before being sent to XXXX. XXXX is the reason that I am still in this mess 3 years later. I had a payment plan set up and paid all of the necessary payments ( Set up by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had contacted them at the end and discovered that no, everything was not squared away and there was paperwork missing - NO ONE let me know any paperwork was missing, and the paperwork that was supposedly missing I had faxed TWICE! I was then informed by XXXX XXXX of XXXX that I would need to start the process all over again. I never received any correspondence from XXXX - no phone calls, no letters that they were no longer servicing my loan. I had to SEARCH MYSELF to figure out where my loans were. I also never received any correspondence from XXXX that they were now servicing my loans. I started all of this in XXXX OF XXXX! THAT IS OVER THREE - 3 YEARS AGO!!!!! 

For someone who is trying to get their loans out of default and make payments, this is disgraceful that no one in within the Federal Education Department can provide accurate and helpful information.

I called Navient on XX/XX/XXXX and attempted to pay off the loan. They informed me the payoff balance was {$3500.00}, but they would not allow me to pay with a credit card, only a debit card.

I called them on XX/XX/XXXX since I noticed that late payment charges were accruing on their online statement, and my check was obviously not deposited. They informed me at that time they had not received the check. I was concerned that they were deliberately holding the check for as long as they could, in order to accrue additional late charges, as this was nearly two weeks since I sent the check. So I told them at that time I would be cancelling the check and would pay immediately with a debit card. I proceeded with the debit payment at that time, in the amount of {$3500.00} which I was informed was the payoff balance. I did receive a confirmation e-mail shortly afterwards on XX/XX/XXXX with the confirmation # XXXX, indicating that the payment was submitted and processed.

I should not have to stay with a variable interest rate. I have attempted to apply repeatedly to a lower interest rate. I have been continuously denied with no explanation as to why. When I call customer service, they ask me questions regarding income, and then tell me that I was denied, but they do not state why. When I have asked, they have stated that they are not sure why, I was just denied. I have never missed a payment, my lowest credit score is XXXX, and I have excellent credit history across every account I have had with any company. I deserve a fixed interest rate at a lower percentage. 

The amount that I owe now is more than four times the original principal, despite the fact that I only completed my education and licensure in the fall. I feel preyed upon and Navient will not offer any remedy, despite multiple attempts to work with them ( email exchange with Navient attached ). I took out {$46000.00} in student loans at age XXXX to pay for school expenses including books and tuition. I assumed that there would be some interest, but I didnt understand what a variable rate was and the impact that this purchase would have on my well being and livelihood. 

I am currently a licensed XXXX XXXX  and I have to work five jobs to pay my monthly payment. The interest only payment is approximately {$2100.00}. I have to pay above the interest to make even the slightest dent in my principal. As a result, I work a full-time job Monday through Friday, and four part time jobs including XXXX at two separate universitys and doing XXXX XXXX at two separate companies. This is not a sustainable practice, I am often exhausted and unable to properly care for myself and my family, I am also a mother. 

I have reached out to Navient multiple times regard additional payment options. I was denied twice via telephone and once via email for loan refinancing. The person I spoke with was unable to state why I did not meet the requirements for loan refinancing, they stated that they enter my information into the system and are provided with the options. The people I spoke with were also unable to tell me what had to be done in order for me to meet loan refinancing requirements with Navient. Additionally, I contacted Navient and was notified that they are unable to modify or settle any of my loans for a lesser value.

03/31/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I was laid off from my employer as they were heavily impacted by the covid19 pandemic. I had reached out to XXXX XXXX in order to apply to any Payment Reduction programs they could offer for borrowers in my position. They approved a reduced payment for a 6 month period for which they later advised could be extended if the application was approved again. When the program had expired, I received an email from the designated department approving the extension of my reduced payments. The following month after receiving this email as well as having a telephone conversation to approve this, I was sent a bill of {$350.00} that needed to be paid immediately on top of the monthly bill I normally receive. I reached out to their offices now for the third time in a month and they advised me that now I would need another Payment Plan on top of the existing XXXX that I made back on XX/XX/XXXX to pay the {$350.00}. I agreed to the second payment plan over the span of 6 months in spite of it now increasing my monthly payments to more than what I originally paid prior to being laid off back in XX/XX/XXXX. They verbally confirmed via telephone call and email that as long as I made my payments on time, the account would NOT be reported as delinquent and that all these arrangements will be updated on my account. After making the first payment reflecting the new amounts and both Payment Arrangement totals on XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX saying that they haven't received a payment and failure to do so would result in my account being reported as delinquent and my co- signer being reported to the credit agency. I reached out the XXXX  XXXX again who in turn communicated that the Account Delinquency letters are computer generated and will continue to be sent until the {$350.00} is paid in full.

I have refinanced my private loans through XXXX, and Sofi/XXXX XXXX. The loan is a 7 year XXXX refinance loan with an interest rate of 5.375 % fixed loan. The loan was issued XX/XX/XXXX.

Between the second half of XXXX and early XXXX, I made several payments to try to bring my balances down. Even though the previous month "" statement dates '' had already passed by, they applied these payments towards a previous month, and towards just one loan - they did not count towards my XX/XX/XXXX due date. Effectively they just went towards principal and interest without effecting my monthly payment amount. I was able to have them re-apply the loans for that month luckily. 

Now, it is XXXX. I made a {$200.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. My typical amount due per month is {$470.00} and it is typically due on the XXXX of every month. The payment was deducted from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. When i log in to VSAC 's web portal, i am told that i still have {$470.00} due. The {$200.00} payment shows as having been made in a seperate section - but to what? How do i know which loan series it was applied to, and how do i know what VSAC expects as the remainder of my monthly payment now? Short answer : I don't. 

I have emailed and called them and have received two different amounts that will be due on XX/XX/XXXX. One representative told me i have credits this month of {$390.00}, meaning i have just about {$80.00} left to pay by XX/XX/XXXX ( i have this in writing ).

My dispute has been on-going since XX/XX/XXXX where my loan holder Sallie Mae now Navient refused to accept my income base repayment plan application or otherwise disclose any legitimate reason for its failure to accept my application until XX/XX/XXXX. Once finally approved on XX/XX/XXXX, payments due were to be {$0.00} from XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a letter to Sallie Mae detailing the history of events and the extraordinary impact their failure to assist me was causing. Multiple telephonic discussions with representatives occurred wherein I requested redress and removal of penalties fees and fines. Acknowledgment of inappropriate application of penalty fees and fines were made with retro-active forbearance, but forbearances provided kept listing incorrect dates. Specifically, a forbearance was provided on XX/XX/XXXX for time frame of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This did not fully account for the entire duration of failing to accept my application and granting me access to the IBR plan. I spoke to a representative again and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a forbearance for time frames XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which were the wrong years. ( By this time I was on the IBR plan specifying {$0.00} due each month : there was no need for a forbearance for those years ). Representatives seemed to never record the correct date. Also, representatives conveyed telephonically that the amount of {$590.00} could be submitted in settlement of this dispute. I remitted payment in the aforementioned amount with the understanding that I maintained my dispute of penalty fees and that remission of payment was made only to prevent further accrual of other fees. SallieMae/Navient applied this amount to private loans without my consent. As a result, I submitted a XX/XX/XXXX letter objecting to allocation to private loans and requested that the {$590.00} be credited to the appropriate account and that the amount of {$590.00} be returned to me upon resolution of disputed late fees. SallieMae/Navient applied the aforementioned amount to federal loans, but otherwise refuse to settle or address disputed late fees and persisted in assessment of penalty fees. At no time, has SallieMae or Navient informed me that penalty fees were associated with any other matter outside those resultant from their purposeful failure to accept my IBR application in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please note that during years of XXXX and XXXX I was recovering from the passing of my husband. I had shared this with representatives during this time frame and asked them to help me and work with me. SallieMae and Navient did the opposite and purposefully denied me access to federal programs. They engaged in high pressure and deceptive tactics to deny me access to plans that would assist me and illicit payments outside of good faith understandings and my then existing IBR plan. They were predators at a time when I needed grace. 

Years have gone by with no recourse or access to dispute resolution. Impacts due to student loans have resulted in negative credit reports ; loss of an employment opportunity on XX/XX/XXXX directly related to student loan reports on my credit history ; significant emotional distress ; and compounded financial distress as Navient continues to assess and accrue penalty fees and fines on my account.

I took out a loan for graduate school between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX, then XXXX XXXX contracted my loan to a XXXX and now to Ascendium. My loan amount then was about {$47.00}, XXXX. Have been paying on my loan since graduation except for XX/XX/XXXX due to XX/XX/XXXX crashed when I lost my job at XXXX/XXXX and I requested forbearance until I had another job in XX/XX/XXXX. Ascendium sent my loan for collection to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX with a hefty collection fees of {$17000.00}. ( see attachment # 1 ). I was having difficulty paying my loan then a {$17.00}, XXXX burden was added bringing the total of over {$64000.00} with interest added ( I do not know how much ). This has been my nightmare. I started paying on my loan by wage garnishment from my Social Security benefits and from the State of Maryland. I last file a complaint with your Office with regards to how my payments are distributed. I never got an answer from Ascendium. I went on their website to only find payment from Social Security Administration and nothing from the State of Maryland accounted towards my account ( see attachment # 2 ). 
Further after examining the loan I downloaded it states a loan date of XX/XX/XXXX and disbursement date of XXXX. I graduated from XXXX University in XXXX. I did not take out any loan in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not in any school whatsoever. So, I need to know where this came from. 

Because of Covid-19 the Former President Donald Trump suspended payment & interest on student loans. And suddenly after he left office my name was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX who is making threats about a law suit. I can not get through to anyone at Ascendium. Their machine will tell you for default loans call the Debt Collector. I do not want to deal with a debt collector, because they are not my loan servicer. All Ascendium has to do is to resubmit request for wage garnish to the Department of Treasury and The State of Maryland ( DHS ) as it was done before and I just have to acknowledge and signature. But they prefer sending my name to one of their cronies. Since it's had to get someone at Ascendium, I went on-line to check my payment history and I am surprise there is NO PAYMENT HISTORY whatsoever. See attachment # 3. 

I would like to know whether this loan dated XX/XX/XXXX is mine or not because I did not request any loan for school in XX/XX/XXXX. If it is the old loan from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I need a complete up-to-date payment history. I tried so many times to get this information from Ascendium but to no avail. ( see attachment # 3-1 ). 

I am XXXX yrs old and I have requested four times for a Public Services Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) for my Federal Consolidated Loans and was denied ( 4 times ) : reasons ( 1 ) Because my loan was not consolidated ( which it says CONSOLIDATED ) on the attachment and ( 2 ) because The State of Maryland Department of Human Services is not a government or public service organization. ( See attachment # 4 ).

I request this matter be thoroughly investigated. Someone is getting rich from this Student Loan repayment schemes.

When I didn't have income and my benefits ran out, it appears that they conveniently never received this form.

I'm now 2 days away from charge off because they're in 4 months default and they STILL will NOT allow me a lower repayment plan!

I expressed to them that this would be the best option because at the minimum, I would be making payments to prevent default. They denied me lower payments so that my loans go further into default!

The agents told me there is nothing I can do as far as those extra payments. I was told to change my payment plan to an income driven and reapply after being in that particular plan for 10 years ... what! My loans will be paid in full before then so why would I change to a higher monthly payment with an income driven repayment and for a longer span of time and still not be able to apply for this?

I had always made payments at least as my billing statements indicated prior to this communication, but have increased it to $ XXXX/month, based on this. With the COVID loan suspension, plus my resumed payments, I have over 12 months of payments, based on this newly discovered criteria.

My student loans are serviced by Nelnet and are due for re-certification on XX/XX/XXXX. I attempted to recertify on XX/XX/XXXX through their website, at which time I received a message that I was ineligible for the IBR and to call the servicer. I called and was told that my income is too high to qualify for the IBR and instead, I would need to start paying in a standard term repayment plan, which would cause my payments to be approximately {$1400.00} per month. They are currently {$280.00} per month and I can not afford an increase of more than {$1100.00} per month. Moreover, my income has not changed significantly to warrant such a high payment, and my eligibility should not have changed either, as the IBR only requires a partial financial hardship ( which a standard repayment amount would be ). I advised that this could not be correct and was placed on hold for a length of time so the person I was speaking with could confirm that what she told me was correct. After that time, she confirmed I was no longer eligible for the IBR but could articulate why, other than to say that my loans were no longer eligible but gave no explanation. I spoke with an account supervisor, who told me I was ineligible for IBR as well but that based on my income, my new payment amount would be approximately {$950.00}. He could not tell me why the amount was different or why my eligibility changed either, but then he re-ran the numbers, admitted me made an error in his calculation and that my new payment would be {$530.00} per month. During a 75 minute conversation, I was given three different payment amounts and no explanation for why I am no longer eligible for the IBR. I feel the information is incorrect and unsubstantiated but I do not know how to get good information or what to trust. I feel this is an annual occurrence with Nelnet and that they have no idea how to properly service my loans or provide accurate information. I am very concerned that they will deny my IBR re-certification, causing me to go into a standard payment plan that I can not afford and also causing my interest to capitalize, which happens if my payment plan changes.

I did not receive notice of any account changes from Navient by mail or email regarding my loads or monthly payments. 
I received a notice of monies due in XXXX of {$84.00} termed a "" past due notice '' via email. I paid this ( although I was unsure what it was for and should have looked into it. ).

I have great concern that Navient is not following the terms outlined in the truth in lending act nor the terms they have set with, at the very least, this borrower to ensure communication is concise and easy to understand. I believe situations like these only benefit the lender, who is then able to collect late fees and extended interest fees.

03/08/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I'M SENDING A COMPLAINT AGAINST 1.FALSE STATEMENTS BY NAVIENT RELEASED TO CFPB IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX NAVIENTS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICE IN DEALING WITH BORROWER XXXX. 

This complaint is against Navient 's false statements to CFPB received in response to complaint XXXX submitted on XX/XX/XXXX : with these false statements they were able to close the case. Please refer to Complaint XXXX and its reply by Navient for explanations. 

1.My last communication with Navient was through Certified post mail XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX in which I sent all the documentation regarding all the communication had in XXXX : letters, e-mails, all Income sensitive Repayment forms filled out with attached documents and explanations of income and tax return with paystub copies, invoices previously sent to them from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX was my last contact with them through their online system. I could not receive any answers through their platform so no contact was done in XXXX as they say. 
I have attached a document with all the temporal communications with Navient : Year XXXX has been added to show continuity of behavior in a repeated, systematic, unfair and deceptive practice engaged by Navient in relation to IRS Plan Form filing. In XXXX forms were sent in 6 times. Finally accepted in XXXX of XXXX. The documentation send in XXXX that was refused the first time, was exactly the same as XXXX ( XXXX statements ). 
2. Proof of income was sent for XXXX with the same specifications of XXXX ( there was absolutely no difference in documents sent in ). 
Last 3 Monthly statements by XXXX images were sent with my first application form for RENEWAL. But to be fair so that all income could be accountable, I decided to send in also all the invoices and statements because XXXX payments ( 3 last stubs requested ) were very low in their amount ( due to summer months ). 
I received a denial by them based on wrong documents with no further explanation, I then sent in exactly what I had sent in the previous year so I would not make mistakes : last 3 XXXX images statements only ( so they wouldnt get confused ) ( see attached pdf ) and attached 1040 that show evident need for ISR Plan renewal.

Navient states on their reply to CFPB that invoices are not a valid proof of income : 1.Income sensitive Repayment Plan Form has a section were it states : Gross monthly income is the total amount of income before taxes and any other deductions are removed.

2. Forms indicates to circle ALL SOURCES that apply. I indicated Self-Employment earnings. Self employment earnings are most of the times supported by invoices to our Clients and not by pay-stubs. I earn Royalties for my images from which I receive monthly statements but for the rest, for self-employment as a freelance photographer its entirely supported only by invoices to Clients.

3.I was also sent in a worksheet with ISR Plan Form to calculate Monthly gross income which lists various earnings included : Salary/Self-employment earnings, Sales commissions, Allowances, Tips etc. It includes all kind of possible income. 
4. On point 2 of the FORM it states : include copies of your most recent pay statements ( or other documentation of your monthly employment income ) For a freelance photographer these documents are mainly invoices. I explained on all my forms that my income was not regular every month so I summed it all up and sent proof of documentation in addition to the last 3 paystubs by XXXX. 

Navient states in their reply that they could not contact me : My contact information has always been active and valid. My e-mail still is the same e-mail as XXXX. I have received every single automatic reply by Navient for my forms and documents and letters sent in. When I had to turn for help to the Student Aid commission I was advised to change my e-mail address to a certified e-mail so mails could be used legally. But I still had my g-mail active that was used by Navient in all the communications ( I just dont have access to internet all the times ). 
My parents address in XXXX was also available. It was indicated on the certified postal mail sent to Navient in XXXX. 
The miscommunication started way before the online update of e-mail address which happened on XX/XX/XXXX. Deceptive actions and neglecting my forms and letters went on from beginning of XX/XX/XXXX till the total end of communications ( to be precise they started from XXXX ). 

Navient actions have improperly caused myself to incur interests, collection costs, fees, that are the result of a practice engaged by Navient that is unfair and deceptive and in violation of Sections 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA.

This deceptive and unfair drill includes continuously, repeatedly, constantly and purposely neglecting and not acknowledging the forms for ISR Plan sent in one after the other, my letters asking for answers, my letters explaining the situation, my 1040s with pay-stubs and invoices, etc, etc.

Now they are persistent in violating Section 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA by releasing a false and deceptive statement to respond to complaint # XXXX in their defense and successfully obtaining a closure of the case solely based on their deceiving statements. 
I understand we are small individuals compared to these unbeatable entities and with no possibility of a lawyer to defend ourselves. I also know it is my word against theirs but it is unfair not to ask for proofs and read the documentation and communications that were sent when the problem arised. Just looking at the 1040 and the gross amount indicated, anyone could see that ISR Plan needed to be renewed.

This malpractice of theirs, brought my Loan back to the starting point after having paid off a large part of the sum by using up all my Savings. Now I find myself having to pay for their deceiving, abusive behaviors.

I did not receive any information about my Loan being transferred to the agency named XXXX and I never received a notice of default letter by Navient or any other agency. 
As a result of this conduct, I find myself now having to deal not with one but two collections agencies asking me to pay for the same absurd debt amount. 

The federal student loan system exists for a single purpose : to serve students and their families. All parties involved in administering federal student loans, including servicer like Navient, must act with honesty and integrity at all times to ensure that the financial aid programs serve the best interests of students. By engaging in these unfair practices, Navient is disrupting this purpose. 
Their responsibility is to best assist borrowers as issues arise over the lifetime of a loan. I had all the qualifications to receive a Renewal for ISR Plan and Navient was supposed to act with honesty knowing that the options for repayment are keyed to the borrowers income and can be short term or long term and need to take account of their financial hardship. My extreme financial hardship showed with no doubts in my 1040 and all the documents submitted. 
If you read the pleading letters and mails sent to Navient asking for acknowledgment you can see clearly the desperation they had me go through in XXXX and XXXX by trying to deal with them in getting my Forms, not only to be excepted, which was not the main issue here XXXX just by looking at my 1040 you could tell how bad my financial status as a single mom was ) but they were completely ignored! ( see the attached form pdf with temporal indication of all the communications between Navient and I ) I came to know from State of Attorney Generals office that numerous investigations have uncovered similar misconduct by Navient.

I was also informed that State of Illinois and State of California found that Navient regularly misled borrowers who were enrolled in Income Driven Repayment plans about the certification they needed to file annually to ensure that they remained enrolled in such plans, and further discovered that Navient consistently made payment processing errors that resulted in borrowers paying unnecessary late fees and, in some cases, entering into delinquency. This appears to me exactly the path I was pushed into. 
Ive always paid my Loan with amounts of more than {$500.00} dollars a month. I was able to pay such a huge amount using my Savings and I would make an extra payment of more than {$1000.00} at the end of each year to cut down the principle. When my financial situation dropped and my savings had been almost fully used up, I had to revise my payments totally. I had no intention not to pay. It clearly reads in my pleading letters attached! 

IN CONCLUSION, NAVIENTS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTIONS RESULTED INTO AN IMMENSE PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INJURY WITH THIS OUTCOME : - Neglect by Navient of forms and letter for Income Sensitive Repayment Plan Re-certification and dishonest evaluation of Documents sent in which purposely delayed the renewal process ( behavior engaged in XXXX and then repeated in XXXX ). 
- Expiration of Deadline for Renewal of Income Sensitive Repayment Plan not due to my untimely intervention but caused by Navient neglecting my re-certification documents. 
- Monthly payments raised to full amount due to Expiration of Deadline - Loss of Rights to continue pay my monthly payments on a calculated percentage of income and family size ( see XXXX ) ( single mom ) - Loss of Rights given by the Federal Government to Income Sensitive Driven Repayment Plans with subsidized Loans to have interests paid by the government during the first 3 consecutive years of enrollment in the plan.

- Loss of Rights of a possible forgiveness of the remaining balance of the federal loan after making 20-25 years of Qualifying Payments - Defaulted Loan - Loan handed to Collection Agencies with all the fees, costs and interested summed to it - IMMENSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN BACK IN XXXX - UNBEARABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN TRYING TO DEFEND MY CASE TODAY PLUS THE IMMENSE FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT I WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS ADDED TO TODAYS FINANCIAL HARDSHIP IM STILL FACING WHICH WILL AGGRAVATE THE SITUATION OF LOSS OF JOB DUE TO LOCK-DOWN. 

Please take in consideration all the information included on this Complaint and give the possibilities to both parties to hand in proofs before closing the Complaint.

I continued to pay my loan as always, but then I received a letter from Peaks stating that my private loan had been settled, and that I no longer would owe on this private loan. At the time I found out this information of no longer owing a balance, I had payment that went through an ACH transaction with my bank that I had previously set up to make every month, in the amount of {$77.00}. According to the settlement paperwork, it states 'Vervent will reject or return any payment on your Peaks Loan that is received after XX/XX/XXXX. I then waited a bit to see if I ever saw a refund on the {$77.00} that was debited from my account via ACH, but I never received the refund. So on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to Peaks Loans, and did as XXXX requested by emailing a bank statement with the withdrawal information, and a trace number the bank provided me for this {$77.00} payment. I was informed I would hear something back, but did not, so I then contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX. I also spoke to XXXX with Peaks Loans this day, and he wanted me to verify that indeed my payment was made ACH, so I called my bank again and verified that it was ACH withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX. With this information I called Peak Loans back and advised them again, that it was an ACH withdraw and XXXX then placed an email to his supervisor, and once he heard something back from them, then he would let me know. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Peaks Loans again and spoke with XXXX, and reassured me he had sent this email and he hadn't heard anything back, so I was to wait to hear back from them. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I decided this was enough time, and called Peaks Loans yet again, and this time I spoke to XXXX again, and he was at a loss and tried to give me a number to call, which in fact was the same phone number in which I had just contacted him at, so that didn't go over very well with me. He then said I needed to call back in 30 minutes because his supervisor was trying to figure out who and where I needed to take this issue to. I then called back 30 minutes later, to get XXXX back on the phone and for him to advise me I would need to reach out to the 'Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ' that there was nothing more that Peaks Loans could do for me, he also provided me with the state attorney generals name and email address.

02/22/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Fraudulent loan,"I was told if I set up auto pay and had a bank account with Wells Fargo that the interest rate would be less. Interest rate is 5.99 %. My loan started repayment XX/XX/XXXX, and I had about {$10.00}, XXXX balance. I am paying more interest each month than principal ( which is definitely not 5.99 % ... more like 55 % ) and the interest is not decreasing as principal decreases. As an example, I paid over {$1100.00} in interest last year and only {$460.00} in principal. I have called several times to see how I can pay sooner to get the principal lower and therefore pay less interest but can not get a straight answer. Since my payment is due on the XXXX of each month, I tried paying on the XXXX for the following month ( to pay ahead and therefore pay less interest ). They then still took the auto payment on the XXXX, which should have then been all toward principal ( but they still took interest ). I'm being told interest is compounded daily but the paperwork I have says APR and it was very misleading. They assessed a late fee when I wasn't late ( I had auto pay ) and the management has been horrible. Now, I received a letter that they are getting out of the student loan business ( which they should because they are ripping off students ) and selling the loan to XXXX XXXX, a division of XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. I feel they should be held accountable for their fraudulent practices and my account should be adjusted correctly. If I compare my Federal student loan ( which is at 4.66 % interest APR ), the computations are totally different between the two. Upon researching Wells Fargo, I see many complaints regarding their student loans and it isn't right that they are just getting away with it and selling out our loans to another firm ( although I am hoping that the management is improved ). I will be looking to refinance as well because I can not afford to be paying for a year and have paid twice as much interest as principal.

During my undergraduate studies, I borrowed from the lender {$9600.00} to pay for tuition and other school related expenses. After graduating in XXXX of XXXX with my degree, I begun making monthly payments to AES starting with my very first payment of {$90.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. In the last 10 years I have made 126 payments in the total amount of {$11000.00}. Today, I only owe {$9200.00}. For the past 4 months I have stopped making these monthly payments as I sought to understand how, after a decade of payments, I have only been able to pay down my debt by less than {$400.00}. I was advised by AES that to receive a response I would need to mail them a letter describing my request. My first letter was sent in early XXXX of XXXX and I have not heard back from anyone to my original letter or those thereafter. In total I have sent 4 letters address to AES and the Office of Consumer Advisory, both located in XXXX, XXXX During this time however they did report my delinquency to the credit agencies which has negatively impacted my credit score. My recent statement notes that my score has declined from a range of XXXX down to XXXX, depending on credit reporting agency. While this is not material to this particular matter it does illustrate the point that I have been a responsible consumer who has always paid their debt as well as the significant impact this has on my future credit worthiness. I have already paid back more than I have borrowed and have not been able to understand from anyone how after 10 years of payments my debt has practically not moved at all. There seems no incentive to continue making these payments for another 10, 20, 30, or potentially 40 years just for them to remain at the same amount as borrowed. I borrowed {$9600.00} with the understanding that I would have to pay that amount back with interest. I firmly believe that after {$11000.00} and 10 years of this financial and mental burden my balance should have decreased by more than {$360.00}. I seek to understand how much of the {$11000.00} should be applied to principal and I wish to settle my debt with AES by paying off the difference between my original balance of {$9600.00} and that principal amount.",None,AES/PHEAA,TN,37777,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4316853

I submitted all documentation to the Department of Education, Sallie Mae and Navient who by the way denied my Identity Theft claim, and now they are stating that they never received any of the documentation. 

I am moving forward with filing a lawsuit against Department of Education and Navient who also bought out Sallie Mae who was also sued as well and having an ongoing lawsuit just like XXXX does.

Sallie Mae was scamming us for years and now Navient is doing the exact same thing. I refuse to pay for student loans that I did not benefit from at all this is beyond ridiculous I reached out to Department of Education who referred me to Navient on XX/XX/XXXX and they have the power to remove the loans that are not mine but refuse in which to do so. 

I have been battling this matter for 8 years and I want these loans removed from Department of Education, Navient, and my credit reports as well. The interest alone is beyond ridiculous.

This is a violation of my civil rights and the right to have due process. I was not even allowed to appeal the process despite the fact that there is an appeal process nor did I receive a letter from Department of Education regarding them denying my Identity Theft claim which is overly ridiculous above and beyond because I sent them all the supporting documentation to support this.

I, XXXX XXXX, am providing this written explanation for the basis of the dispute concerning the balance changes for consolidation loans 2-08 and 2-09. I will also provide documentation as requested by the Navient representative. 
I am currently in the home buying process over the next several months and ask that Navient understand and empathize with me concerning the significance of changes to my credit report during this time. 
I have reached out to Navient representatives to explain the balance changes for consolidation loans 2-08 and 2-09. No one could successfully identify documentation for the change, the reason for the change, or explain the difference. Therefore, the Navient representative submitted an escalated request for my consolidated loan balances to be reviewed, requesting an explanation of the changes. I have reviewed both in boxes in my Navient portal, and the latest documents posted since the approved consolidations are the tax statements ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the quarterly interest statements ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Previously, Navient has uploaded supporting documentation in my Navient portal concerning any changes to my account balances for any reason. My mortgage loan is currently in the underwriting process, and the lender will pull my credit again before the approval is final. The last report pulled by the lender reflects my consolidation loan balances foXXXX XXXX XXXX {$220000.00} XXXX and XXXX XXXX {$27000.00} XXXX, as they are shown in the approved loan consolidation and repayment plan totaling {$250000.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my loan balance has changed significantly. 
The increase of {$9500.00} has increased my student loan debt, which might affect my debt to income ratio. It could postpone or stop the mortgage loan approval and closing date altogether. 
I hope that Navient understands the severity of my current situation and is aware of how critical it is for accurate reporting to my credit and providing documentation to the lender for such relevant changes. I am clueless about the details of the balance increase and became even more confused after speaking to two Navient representatives that were just as puzzled as me. 
All in all, I have committed a great deal of my time and finances to reach the mortgage goal of buying a home.

I, also, noted on numerous occasions that I was worried my account would be too delinquent and asked for it to process my loan cancelation application promptly.

Again, UAS kept telling me that I need not make payments to my loan because it will backdate my account and I should not worry.

09/30/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I recently looked back at the life of my student loans with Navient. My complaints are two part : 1. is I let them auto apply my payment, since it would be easy. I discovered that their auto payment process, allocates the majority of my payment to the low interest loans. The high ( 6.8 % ) interest loans were paid {$30.00} a month vs. the low interest ( 2.5 % ) loans of similar amounts had $ XXXX dollars applied to them per month. This equaled a lot more in interest paid each month than there should have been over the last 6-7 years.

2. The second issue is how interest is applied month over month. Many months when larger payments were made, the following month had more interest charged ( as much as $ XXXX more per month in interest ) than the previous month, even though there was less principle to charge interest on. The payments were made ontime every month for the last 7 years. So I don't understand how and why many times interest charges fluctuated by as much as {$50.00}. Over 7 years. {$18000.00} in interest charges were paid out of {$42000.00} paid. With the largest interest rate being 7 %, And many of the loans at 3 % this is ridiculous! That's 50 % interest or an average of 7 % interest per year. Higher than the interest rate on my most expensive loans! And I was paying significant principle payments over those 7 years!

When I called in XXXX, I found out that they had not submitted a review of all 11 payments, only 6 of them. At that point I requested that they start a review of the other 5 payments as well. 

I contacted them again around XX/XX/XXXX, 8 months after the initial review. They stated there was no update and the review was still pending. 

It has now been 10 months and the review is still "" pending ''. Even though XXXX told me from day 1 that she could see the error in the servicer 's records, and that all 11 payments should have counted, they still have not completed the review. 

In addition to this, around XX/XX/XXXX I submitted updated paperwork for another year of completed services towards PSLF. They still have not updated my totals to reflect these 12 months ( I submit new documentation annually now ), over 10 weeks later. 

I will finish my 120 payments in 21 months. But without a successful completion of these reviews, plus a timely response of my updated PSLF activity, it will not be possible to complete my 120 payments and have my loans forgiven. 

All I ask is that my reviews be completed and my accounts updated correctly and in a timely manner. This would have taken XXXX 5 minutes to do, if she had access to update the account to begin with ; yet 10 months later and still nothing.

The expectation is that they go off of the amount of on time loan payments originally reported to them when they first got the loans.

02/23/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Heartland ECSI has been retaliating against me regarding my complaints about their service. 

I obtained multiple student loans through my school, XXXX. For now, my school chooses to service its student loans through Heartland ECSI. My school put all student loans into forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. Heartland ECSI sent me a false statement for XX/XX/XXXX saying I owed {$1200.00}. I then received another false statement for XX/XX/XXXX saying I owed {$1500.00}. Heartland said that it would fix the statements. 

Heartland makes it extremely difficult and time consuming for borrowers to make payments towards a single loan. I prefer to apply extra payments to loans XXXX at a time to pay them off faster, thereby removing a payment. I also target the higher interest loans first. Heartland requires borrowers to make a payment, which is applied against each loan. In my experience, most of the money has gone to the lowest interest loans, thereby extending the length of the loans. Entering this payment takes a few days. The borrower must then contact XXXX 's customer service to enter a request to adjust the loan to be applied against only XXXX loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an extra payment of {$2800.00}. I then requested that this payment be applied to a single loan. Because Heartland had not fixed the false statements that it had been sending me since XXXX, I was misled into believing that my account was current. The next month, I was surprised when I was informed that I needed to make my monthly student loan payment for XXXX AND for XXXX. 

It took many conversations over several months to figure out that this is what had happened. After I informed XXXX 's customer service rep that I was saving my conversations with them, Heartland removed the option from the end of my chats to save a PDF of the chat. I have been saving XXXX docs and screenshots now instead. 

Just today, I was informed that if I want to keep making one-time extra payments in the manner that XXXX told me to many months ago, I need to be aware that Heartland XXXX deny my requests to adjust those payments to apply only to a single loan. Instead, the rep suggested that the preferred method is to set up an automatic recurring payment. That would be fine if I had a fixed extra amount that I was paying on a regular basis. But I do not. That means that XXXX 's default of applying payments to the lowest interest loans will lengthen the amount of time borrowers are forced to service their loans with XXXX and deal with their misleading and dishonest business practices.",None,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,AL,35243,None,Consent provided,Web,02/23/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4159406

07/01/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Here is the letter I sent to Navient ( I have removed the personal information as requested ) XXXX Customer Communications Navient XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX PA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I received your explanation ( attached ) of the amount you believe we owe. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the letter from you folks back in XXXX, indicating the amount you think we owe. I immediately called your offices, and a gentleman told me that he would send an explanation, as well as the paperwork we would need to dispute this claim. In your explanation there was no such paperwork. We received another warning letter from you the other day, so I am writing this and you can consider this letter to be notification that we dispute your claim. 

As you indicate we sent a lump sum payment in XXXX, and we did so believing that this large payment was payment in full for the remaining balance. That was our intention. We were not notified following that payment that there was any remaining balance. 

According to your explanation the amount of the payment was applied to loan XXXX as well as to loan XXXX which you state was paid ahead until XX/XX/XXXX, and that they both originated in XXXX ( our record of the XXXX loans attached ). We have no record of a loan XXXX or XXXX. As far as we knew, our Sallie Mae account number was either xxxxxxx or xxxxxxxxxxxx. ( see attached ). Further, as one of the attachments indicates, we had received several letters at various points indicating that various loans were paid off. It was almost 20 years ago when our daughter started college, but if I recall, each year required a new loan, and I believe there were consolidations as well. 

Since this was so long ago, and since we have received no communication from anyone about this since XXXX, Im afraid Id have to take your word that we have an unpaid principal balance of either {$2400.00} or {$2600.00} ( your letter states both amounts ). We have never, ever, failed to pay a debt so in the spirit that this may have been some kind of misunderstanding, not to mention that you yourself seem uncertain which is correct, I have enclosed a check for the lower amount. If you had simply told us in XXXX that we still owed that amount we would have paid it then. 

We do not, however, accept your claim that we owe anything beyond that amount, and certainly not at the interest rate indicated of 6.125 %. To be kind, this rate is usurious at best and predatory lending at worst. Im not sure you would agree with that but perhaps the folks on copy will, considering that interest rates are at an all time low ( fed funds rate approximating zero ). 


I am copying these people, not for our benefit, but for those without the latitude that we have. Is there any wonder that there are so many people graduating from college, saddled with a mountain of debt, and unable to pay it off in their lifetimes? Multiplying this convoluted instance across thousands of people would go a long way toward providing the reason. We are able to pay this debt. Indeed we thought we had done so with the $ XXXX lump sum payment in XXXX as you acknowledge, only to learn 7 years later that the meter has still been running at 6.125 % interest. We have no issue with a company making a profit, but we do have an issue with a company gouging customers graduating from college through deceptive lending practices.

The new amount was shown along with the {$12000.00} of accrued interest they had added. As I was unable to look into this further, I did not realize what was happening with my student loan balances until I began to really focus on my credit and clear up any and all inaccuracies on my credit reports later in XXXX. After getting my credit report completely cleared up and removing most inaccurate information, the only ( and largest ) inaccuracy left was the balance ( s ) showing for my student loans. Somehow, when the loan servicer changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX  XXXX, to now Nelnet, the balance of about {$40000.00} ( a total of {$29000.00} in unsubsidized AND subsidized student loans taken in XXXX ) had been inflated with false information and now appeared as two separate loans of over {$55000.00} and {$24000.00}, respectively. I contacted Nelnet via email and phone on XX/XX/XXXX and have continuously been in contact via email and telephone several times monthly since then. Most recently ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) I was told that my prior servicer would have to be contacted to fix the amounts that were now showing, but my prior servicer said that they have nothing to do with how my current balances are being shown and reported to the credit bureaus and it is Nelnet that would have to address these errors. 
In order to more fully prove the issue at hand, I requested a copy of my master promissory note from XXXX when my loans were consolidated. It clearly showed a total of less than {$29000.00}. Even after this, I have been unable to get Nelnet to correct the incorrect loan balances as well as the capitalized and accrued interest they have applied to the vastly inflated principal balance. I have been told to contact the Department of Education ( even though they show my loan information accurately ) and to contact FAFSA, which has nothing to do with an inaccurate student loan balance. I am at the point where I am going to have to hire a lawyer, which is going to take any and all savings that I have set aside, just to get my student loan balances reported correctly and to remove the additional tens of thousands of dollars Nelnet has erroneously added on to my principal balance.

I have always made regular payments. I had opted for electronic document delivery in which XXXX XXXX maintained my statements and documents ; any time I needed them I only had to login to XXXX XXXX. 

This year, XXXX XXXX announced they were exiting the student loan business and my loan would be transferred to Firstmark Services, a division of Nelnet. 

I was reassured by XXXX XXXX that the transfer would be seamless, I would be able to access all of the information regarding my loan, for example statements, tax statements, etc. with XXXX as I was with XXXX XXXX. 

My loan was transferred, the automatic payment process was seamless. I did have some initial minor problems in registering for my Firstmark account, however this was resolved upon calling Firstmark customer service. 

My monthly statements and other documents were not transferred. These are important to me as I periodically need these when I balance out my home accounts and budget. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX kindly requesting that they transfer my statements and documents to Firstmark. They responded that the people at Firstmark are who I should be contacting as they are now 100 % in control of my loan and loan servicing, would have this information to provide as all was transferred to Firstmark. 

I contacted Firstmark customer service with a very simple request, quote, "" please provide me with my monthly statements that I had when my loan was being maintained by XXXX XXXX. '' Now I don't think this is a particularly hard to understand non unreasonable request particularly as this loan amount is big and clearly profitable given I have never been delinquent on this or any loan for that matter, and make regular monthly payments as agreed and plan to continue to do so till the loan is paid off. 

All I want are the monthly statements I could access with XXXX XXXX accessible to me once again. And if they can't get them all, then at a minimum, the statements from this year for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

And failing the above, then if they can just tell me for each of the months this year, thus XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX - of each of these payments, how much went to principal and how much went to interest as these 2 details are the 2 critical details I need to enter into my accounting and budgeting software. 

So I don't think this is too much to ask however Firstmark at the moment seem entirely unwilling to provide me with this information. 

As a sidenote, I have not received my tax documents related to this account, Firstmark seems unwilling to provide this to me either, although at the moment I am not in need of this, however will need it in due course. 

I would be grateful for your help in communicating with Firstmark, hopefully the result will be me getting the information I need.

I applied for loan forgiveness countless times in which I was more than qualified for the loan forgiveness and told either I was not by a representative of Navient or there was no response to my submissions at all. I applied for the XXXX  Loan forgiveness and the student loan forgiveness. I tried working out reasonable income based driven repayments only to end up with a repayment amount that was a few dollars lower ort the bulk amount divided into payments to be made in the same month that added up to the original amount. I was advised by representatives of Navient to put file for forbearances which I did on multiple occasions and when those ran out to apply for economic hardship. ( there is interest still accrued but the payment amounts were so high that the only alternative was to apply for the forbearances or hardships. The payment amount Navient imposed was so high it made it impossible to pay back all the loan payments in a month which added to {$900.00} per month. As a single person sole dependent supporting myself that was a large portion ot my gross monthly income which made it impossible to survive. 
In addition, the payments I had made years ago were eaten up with interest that was capped every time my loans were moved around to different servicers only to end up at Navient again. Also I never agreed to have these loans moved They were arbitrarily moved around and made impossible to track. The identification numbers for the loans were changed several times and the amounts do not add up. The dates and amounts are duplicated and do not match with the classes taken during those times. Grant money I received does not seem to be applied to the loans either. Please look into this as well. I requested promissory notes for the loans since the new breakdown of my loans do not add up and seem to be doubles and multiple loans dispersed on the same dates for the same amounts. I receive relentless robocalls from Navient and they have impacted on my credit report. I recently called to ask about the hold placed on federal loan payments due to corona virus and was told that my Stafford load is not a federal loan but a private load. When I took out that loan, I was informed it is a federal Stafford loan and has been for years and suddenly Navient tells me it is not and I am not eligible for the covid suspension. Navient has given inaccurate or deceptive information for years. These loans can not possibly be repaid, and they have more than doubled. I can not get straight information and have all but given up with this company. I have requested that their business practices be looked into with multiple government agencies over the years only to find out in recent years I am not the only borrower who has been victimized by Navient but borrowers in the tens of thousands who have been deceived, mislead and violated by unethical business practices designed to keep borrowers finacially enslaved while Navient reaps the monetary benefits through corrupt financial servicing tactics that has not only negatively impacted student borrowers loans but their financial futures as well. Navient has submitted negative information to credit reporting services that can impact on future employment opportunities, financial stability, and overall economic wellbeing to individuals and out country as a whole.

The company advised that my loans were transferred, and I have FFELP loans which I have no information on or can see when a transferred occurred in my account details online. In addition, I have also requested all my statements and payments made on this account. I have yet to receive any statement since this account was established. I checked my emails and somehow statements that dated back to XXXX are no longer available on Navient 's site, but they were before. It showed all of my balances, payments made, etc. I have no way of knowing what my balances were and account details on what occurred on my account to ensure the accuracy. I have attached a complete view of all I am able to see on my account that is dated back to XX/XX/XXXX although I have been out of school since XXXX. My statements should still be there. It has been a few weeks now, maybe a month where they advised they would provide my statements and have not. Please see the attachment. This information on my statement is vital as one student loan was paid off that was around the same amount that Navient is advising that I owe. I would like all of my statements provided to me in a timely manner. This is my 2nd request. 

I do not want to speak to Navient customer service as they are rude and unprofessional. I prefer email to contact me and discuss. I have mentioned previously that I am a XXXX and have yet to be contacted by someone who can assist veterans in Navient. 

In addition, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification that my account was in forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached the correspondence in this complaint. I still received 7 delinquency notices during this time that affected my credit, although per the letter my account was in forbearance. Navient changed reporting terms from on XX/XX/XXXX not in XX/XX/XXXX when they notified me my loan was in forbearance, no correspondence was sent in XX/XX/XXXX indicating my loan was in forbearance during covid. Instead Navient chose to report to the credit bureaus non payment during the pandemic then change terms on XX/XX/XXXX to what ever they feel is necessary for them. My credit report for Navient looks like a jigsaw puzzle as many times as this company has changed my account status in the past year is sad to us hard working employees who like myself were essential during the pandemic working for the city government. I am requesting to be contacted by email or the conversation will continue in this complaint. I do not want to speak to a Navient representative, because they are not nice and they give me anxiety. This is ruining my credit since the last year and I have no way to tell any payments or confirm what student loan I paid off of XXXX that could be this account. This again is because I have yet to see any statements from prior to XXXX on my account, which were there before. 

From the attached statement "" This forbearance will not count against your voluntary forbearance time.

'' I used the PSLF tool on XXXX so that I could submit the information about my employer, but the tool did NOT work, even after trying multiple browsers and different days. I tried contacting the Federal Student loan office by phone several times and the people that I was able to get in contact with told me that there was nothing they could do about the online tool not working and there was no alternate way to submit that information.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice that my employment was certified along with an update of my qualifying my payments. Now on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my paperless inbox from FedLoan with the subject "" PSLF Qualifying Payment Update '' which, in summary, just states that I now have ZERO qualifying payments, however there was no specific explanation as to why this randomly happened. I called FedLoan on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that there is an additional letter that I was supposed to receive stating that my employer was determined as not qualified due to being for-profit. I have yet to receive the letter, but I received the updated qualifying payment status letter. I have already submitted a request on the studentaid.gov website, which still is very buggy. I shouldn't have to do all this work to get my employer certified and I am increasing confused as to how and why those involved with this process have the inability to research and read. There is a plethora of information related to the Federal Home Loan Bank System on various .gov websites as well. Additionally, we are well aware that the PSLF program has been grossly mishandled and administrated in the past and now that FedLoan is not renewing their contract and no other servicer handles PSLF, I am extremely concerned. I feel like the number of hoops and continuous attempts to get this corrected is NOT my burden, as the Federal Home Loan Bank system has been an integral part of this countrys financial system since the XXXX 's. I think they are hung up on the "" for profit '' part instead of the fact that the Federal Home Loan Banks are govt entities and per the application form and anything that I can see, should qualify without issues.

Ever since I entered repayment with Sallie Mae they have made it IMPOSSIBLE for me to pay my balances seamlessly. Firstly, the system online only allows you to either enrol in auto-debit or pay with a checking account, no debit/card payments can be submitted. When trying to register my international account ( please bear in mind I live in XXXX ), the account can not be added due to their system not allowing other bank accounts registered outside of the USA. I could submit payments by phone, however their line does not accept international calls either. When trying to submit any payment with my bank in XXXX, they just simply reject it ( please see attachment ). We have resorted to submitting payments through their online chat and paying with my co-signers card as a "" third-party ''. This has worked okay, not ideal but okay ; however as of Today XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, I have been notified I can no longer submit debit/credit card payments over the chat either! There are so many ways they could help us make seamless payments, but it seems they're purposely making the submission of payments more impossible than it already is.

This is not correct. The overpayment should be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, this I how my previous servicer allocated payments and this is how Firstmarks website advertises their overpayments will be allocated. I have requested this because about the same time that Firstmark took over my loan I went back to school for my XXXX ( in XXXX ) and was in deferment but was still making regular monthly payments. These payments were not being applied correctly and therefore have effected the amount of interest I am paying vs. principle. In addition, over the past year and a half I have been paying in excess of my regular monthly payment in order to try to get the loans paid off, and none of those excess payments were being allocated correctly either. 
Discovery : This was discovered in XXXX when I went to pay off one of my loans. It had a remaining balance of around {$930.00} and I made a payment of {$950.00}. After a couple of days I went online to check to make sure the loan was paid off and it wasnt because the overpayment was split up between my open loans. It is important to note that two of my loans have interest rates that are the same and are lower than the other two which have the same interest rate and are high. A few months prior to discovering this, one of the higher rated loans had been paid off and as a result of the {$950.00} payment allocation the 2nd loan with the high interest rate was also paid off. *this comes up later in the requests Request : I have made multiple phone calls and requests in order to get this resolved with Firstmark going back to XXXX. I was first told it would take 2 weeks to review. 4 weeks later I followed up with them via their online contact sheet on XXXX asking for an update. To which they replied that it was corrected. When I went online only the last {$950.00} payment was reallocated and not the whole history of payments like I had requested to them on the phone and in writing. I filled out another online contact form on XX/XX/XXXX explaining in more detail what was needed and again requested that all payments would be reviewed. I received a response that my request was received on XX/XX/XXXX and that the payment request was under review which would take XXXX weeks for processing. I then followed up via phone call on XXXX and the customer service rep told me that nothing was reallocated because the 2 loans with the highest interest rate have been paid off. I again explained my story and advised what I wanted to be done. The rep seemed like she understood, said she was going to talk to her supervisor, escalate the matter and have someone contact me within a couple of days.

08/13/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I first applied for loan forgiveness under PSLF in XX/XX/XXXX ; I was told I was ineligble, but not told why. I reconfigured my loan payment to increase payment amount so that i could get out of debt faster. The informaiton I was given by FedLoans at this time gave me no clue as to why I was rejected in the first place -- my decision to change loan type was driven solely by a desire to get rid of debt faster. I didn't know that I was making myself eligible for PSLF -- the information made it seem like I was simply -- -not eligible. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was encouraged by a friend to apply again. As a result of that, I had one loan ( XXXX XXXX ) forgiven, but the XXXX XXXX  had met only a small number of the total required payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted FedLoan to ask why the subsidized wasn't fulfilled. Employee XXXX XXXX ID XXXX ) put in a review for me. He agreed with me that it seemed there should be more of the payments eligible. 

I found out on XX/XX/XXXX, that my review was complete. The only information I was given ( pdf available to provide evidence ) was : "" Thank you for contacting FedLoan Servicing. Per your request we have completed our review of your eligible and qualifying payment counts in your pursuit of Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). We can confirm your payment count is accurate and now consider the matter closed. '' There was no information on why. I called that day and talked to XXXX ( ID XXXX ). He told me he saw that I was paying both subsidized and ubsubsidized under the same payment plan for the entire duration of my loan repayment, so it did not make sense that one was qualified and the other was not. He put in a dispute for me, but had no information on whether I would receive a response. 

Additionally, on the information with my account, the payments listed as ineligible say that the primary reason they are ineligible is : "" I have an ineligible payment plan. '' Eligible payments started in XX/XX/XXXX, but in XX/XX/XXXX, they stopped being eligible. I believe this was when I consolidated from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to FedLoan. When doing so, there was no information given to me that indicated anything was changing on my loan repayment type, and there was no information about PSLF at all -- if there had been that information, I would have known to take the correct action. In fact, I did not even know PSLF was a THING until about XXXX. How could I have known that I was "" not on an eligible repayment plan '' unless I was given the information that I was or was not? 

Further evidence of this being the case is that the loans I paid between XXXX and XXXX are eligible under TEPSLF, but not PSLF. This indicates that my original loan wasn't eligible until Obama expanded it ( which I only learned about within the past few months ). Again, if this information was readily available and explained when I first went into repayment ( when I was already employed by an eligible employer ), let ALONE when I reconsolidated with FedLoan, none of this would have happened. I understand I am responsible for finding information out -- but how would I have known to look for something I was not informed existed?

Additional information on my loan page says : For your payments to count towards PSLF and TEPSLF forgiveness, the payment must be received within 15 days of the due date. I have paid diligently for 140 total payments now. I used autopay in order to avoid missing any payments and to ensure I paid on time. 

It feels to me that this process has been constructed to be confusing and unclear. The amount of information given on PSLF and acceptance/rejection is minimal and completely unhelpful. I have felt lost and frustrated because I can't get any answers on how any of this happened.

I have now paid 140 payments toward my loans, 20 more than the required number for loan forgiveness. Given that ONE of my loans was eligible -- under the SAME plan as the other -- there is no reason that I can understand why I would not be eligible for complete forgiveness.

Lastly, please note that I have worked for the same public university the entire time I have been repaying my loans. There has been no gap in my employment, though my loan eligibility summary says there are two payments that need verification of employment.

I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 90 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX as well as 120 days late in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I immediately disputed this information with NELNET LNS and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''.

Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

07/24/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I applied for Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program in XXXX, after graduating XXXX XXXX at XXXX in XXXX. I had borrowed approximately {$210000.00} during my years XXXX. Per the loan agreement, I agreed to pay income based repayments for 10 years at a non for profit for 10 years and practice in a rural setting. Doing so would result in forgiveness of the remaining balance of the loan. Since signing the loan agreement, I have completed 3 years of XXXX  and 8 years practicing in a "" rural setting. '' During this time, I fulfilled all of my payment obligations, which per the loan agreement, were income driven repayments. I was required to submit income verification annually and did so. For the past 8 years, my payments have been over {$2300.00} a month. 

My 10 years ( 120 payments ) should have expired in XX/XX/XXXX. When I called the loan servicer, fedloans.org to inquire about this in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told the expiration was XX/XX/XXXX. However, it is now XX/XX/XXXX and per the fedloans website, I still owe 74 payments in the amount of {$190000.00} that are apparently to website, are "" in question ''. More importantly, myfedloan states I still owe payments until XXXX! 

In the past 18 months, I have called no less than 30 times to find out why my loan status has not been changed. I've spoken to countless operators and supervisors. Most recently, an operator stated the loan administrators were "" on an island '' and there was no way to talk, email, or reach them for answers. I am constantly told its simply a "" paper tracking '' issue for 18 months. I was also told my case is "" flagged '' as well as the term "" expedited '' so all calls are tracked. Now, I am here 18 months later without change in my 74 payment status. 

I have an urgent need to get this rectified as starting in XX/XX/XXXX, as if I don't continue to make these large payments, ( despite already having completed all terms of the agreement ), I could be in "" default ''. My license to XXXX  XXXX XXXX may be revoked. I have overpaid in my calculations a {$210000.00} loan to {$280000.00}. And yet still {$190000.00} owed, how is that? Because of this situation, I am in limbo career wise. I, as a XXXX, can not even get approved for a car loan. I have been compliant with my end of the contract for the last now ELEVEN years, but yet I still have {$190000.00} outstanding debt? I have my bank statements to verify my payments as well.

According to my research, there have been multiple states with lawsuits against the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program. Not only for the gross mismanagement, but near obsolete communication of the company. I have reached out to my WV Attorney General XXXX XXXX for help. Upon search the CFPB complaint database, I have found many similar complaints about this program.

07/23/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"To whom it may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX, and I graduated from XXXX University with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. I also graduated from Vermont  XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX with an XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I took out many loans to attend both of these schools, with every intent of paying them back. The issue at hand regards a Federal Perkins Loan of {$2000.00} that I took out in addition to several private loans in order to attend XXXX. Heartland ECSI was the servicer for this particular loan. While I did complete a virtual exit interview with Heartland ECSI at the end of my last semester at XXXX, by the time the 12 month grace period had ended, this loan had slipped to the back of my mind. 

At this point, Heartland ECSI began sending physical notices through the mail that the grace period had ended and payments were due. However, these notices were being sent to my previous residence ( my Mother 's house ). While my mother informed me that I was receiving mail from Heartland ECSI, I had assumed that is was in regard to a nearly identical loan that I took out during my time at Vermont XXXX College, which I have not missed a payment on. I checked my account online, and there were no perceivable issues. A point can be made here that Heartland ECSI 's website/repayment interface is confusing. They require you, the borrower, to set up separate loan accounts under the same username, which I had done for my Vermont XXXX College loan, but not my XXXX loan. Therefore, when I logged into my account, there was nothing regarding late payments or anything of that nature. At that point I chalked it up to a glitch and figured if there was an issue, I would receive a phone call or an email. 

Unfortunately for me, I did not receive any additional correspondence, and the loan went into collections. This was very poor timing, as I was trying to refinance my student loans at the time due to the fact that my minimum private student loan payments were around {$1800.00} a month. Because I had delinquent loan on my credit report, I was immediately rejected by any refinancing lender. At this point, I figured I should try contacting XXXX to see if I could receive any assistance with this issue, as I saw it as a simple miscommunication with joint accountability which could be easily resolved. I also brought up the issue to one of my peers, who told me that he had had the same exact situation happen to him. He told me that he simply disputed the delinquency status on his credit report, and got the issue resolved with relative ease. This gave me hope. 

Yet again, unfortunately, things did not go my way. I disputed the delinquency status on the loan twice through Transunion, with no luck. I contacted XXXX twice, the first being a voicemail left with the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) department of XXXX. The department felt no obligation to respond to me directly, and went directly to the collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The second being a very descriptive email to the then President of XXXX at the time, XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX assured me that this would get taken care of, and told me that someone from XXXX would be in contact. This amounted to no progress whatsoever. 

At this point, frustrated as can be, I abandoned my efforts to try and reason with unreasonable people, and set my sights on doing whatever it takes to be approved for a refinance. While my income has been a little over {$50000.00} a year since starting my current job in XXXX of XXXX, {$1800.00} a month, on top of rent and other basic expenses, had me living paycheck to paycheck during this time. Luckily for me there was a global pandemic happening and Federal Student Loan payments were frozen. I truly do not know what I would have done if they were not frozen, because that would have been an additional {$200.00} a month. 

So I did what I had to do, and borrowed {$2800.00} ( {$800.00} added to the balance for collection fees ) cash from my mother to pay the full balance to the collection agency. But it doesn't stop there, as it can take about to a month and a half or so for a credit report to update. This being said, I patiently waited for my credit report to update, only for it to show a balance of {$6.00} remaining on the delinquent loan. Despite wanting to pull my hair out, I paid the remainder of the balance, and waited an additional month and a half for the credit report to update. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a refinance and didn't get immediately rejected. Now, I have been making monthly payments for my now consolidated private loans of about {$1000.00} a month, with an interest rate of about 3 % instead of around 8 %. 

I do not hold any bitterness towards XXXX XXXX XXXX, as they were only doing their job. They also pointed me in the direction of a non-profit student loan lender ( XXXX ) to refinance my student loans. The big takeaway from this is that I think that XXXX and Heartland ECSI should take their respective accountability, as I have done. This situation could also have been very easily remedied and was not, and as a result, I suffered extensive unnecessary hardship.",None,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,NY,12203,None,Consent provided,Web,07/23/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4565607

The means that loans with larger balances would receive more of the payment and loans with lower balances would receive lest of the payment. XXXX payments are not applied per standing instructions. Your payment was applied correctly. '' Though I was confused by this, and uncertain if the math checked out, they retroactively applied the XX/XX/XXXX payment correctly and so I moved on. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a extra payment using the XXXX XXXX award of {$1200.00}. I had no minimum due and no interest on any of my loans. I explicitly asked that it be applied to a specific loan ( in accordance with the one I had prioritized in my twice-approved standing instructions XXXX. They applied {$450.00} to the loan I indicated, and then {$760.00} XXXX a majority of the payment ) to a different loan. Not only did this violate my twice-approved standing instructions, it contradicted what Fedloan servicing indicated regarding how they apply XXXX Payments : the payment was not applied to all loans ( only 2 of 7 ) nor was it applied proportionally ( the smaller of the 2 loans paid received a majority of the payment ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email through their website indicating their repeated mistake and have not heard back, nor has the issue been corrected. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made another extra payment using the XXXX XXXX award of {$2400.00}. I had no minimum due and no interest on any of my loans. I explicitly asked that it be applied to a specific loan ( in accordance with the one I had prioritized in my twice-approved standing instructions XXXX. They applied {$930.00} to the loan I indicated, and then {$1300.00} ( a majority of the payment ) to a different loan, paying it in full. Once again, not only did this violate my twice-approved standing instructions, it contradicted what Fedloan servicing indicated regarding how they apply XXXX Payments : the payment was not applied to all loans ( only 2 of 7 ) nor was it applied proportionally ( the smaller of the 2 loans paid received a majority of the payment ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a direct debit payment was made. While the excess portion of that payment was allocated correctly, due to their previous misallocation of payments one of the loans is considered paid in full and no payment was made toward it. If the previous misallocations ( from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) are corrected, then there will have been a balance due on this specific loan and the payment made on XX/XX/XXXX will likely need to be reallocated to reflect that.

4. On XX/XX/XXXX, Navient indicated that my Total Current Balance is {$110.00}. This amount is the total balance it ascribes to loans # XXXX ( {$110.00} ) and # XXXX ( {$1.00} ), both of which I have paid in full. I have contacted Navient several times to update my balance to {$0.00} for both loans, and it has refused to do so. [ Navient _ All Loan DetailsXXXX_XXXXpdf ] 5.

I realized on XX/XX/2021 that the check was inappropriately applied to all loans and contacted FedLoan Servicing via the chat feature. I was informed I would need to call in to have my payment reapplied that that I can not target specific loans via mailed-in payments. 

I called on XX/XX/2021 to have the check reapplied and was again told I would need to call in each and every time I sent a payment to have the check target a specific payment. I informed the servicer that their website reads : "" The easiest way to target your payments is to pay online. However, if you want to have all of your future extra funds applied in the same way, you can write to us and provide standing instructions [ ... ] You will need to specify how you want your extra funds applied to your individual loans, and you'll need to identify your loans by disbursement date and loan type ( which you can find in Account Access ). We can help you through this process if you contact us [ ... ] '' https : //accountaccess.myfedloan.org/contactUs/index.cfm I again asked for clarification that I CAN NOT send a check and have it applied to specific payments and was told not unless I call in after each check clears to have it reversed and reapplied. The servicer attempted to walk me through the online application system to have it ACH 'd from my account, which I have no interest in doing for extra payments. 

I informed the servicer I would be escalating this to the CFPB and advised they escalate the call to their immediate supervisor. The customer service representative stated he would note this call on my account. 

I have since provided an email through their platform using the CFPB sample template, but still feel I received inadequate information, false/misleading information, and that my payments were inappropriately applied. FedLoan Servicing has no incentive to honor consumer requests as students can not refinance their loan for better interest rates or, if they do, risk loosing federal-loan benefits.

07/18/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Re : Complaint regarding deceptive student loan relief I am filing this complaint due to serious and ongoing deceptive practices by Higher Level Processing/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a student debt relief company. 

I am requesting a full refund of all fees paid to Higher Level Processing due to material misrepresentations and violations of the Telemarketing Sales Rules no upfront fee provision, as well as a refund of the {$29.00} monthly fees that XXXX/HLP lied to me about as being needed to stay on the program.

These practices resulted in serious material and immaterial harm both financial and otherwise ; defrauding me of over {$2000.00} while leaving me in a worse position financially and credit-wise than before I signed on with them. They provided no actual value or benefit and only impacted me negatively. 

They missed making payments on my behalf to my XXXX XXXX XXXX, ruining my credit score with three missed payments and preventing my family from being able to get a house which we otherwise would have been able to. They were in full and total control of my account ( they created a login for me, illegally, in the Dept. of Educations studentaid.gov website ) when they missed the payments and pocketed my money instead. I repeatedly asked them for my student loan login information, and they sent me emails with blank login information so that I could never log into my own accounts. 

I signed on with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. After researching further, I now believe that their first company name was created as part of their deceptive marketing process so that people would confuse the XXXX  student loan data system previously used by Dept. of Ed, with their company abbreviation XXXX  which they used often in client documentation and communications. 

At some point later that year they apparently rebranded to Higher Level Processing. I have proof of this in my included documentation, which is an email from XXXX XXXX ( the sales rep that signed me on at XXXX ) but with Higher Level Processing listed in her signature. Yet at that time the email address still went to her my-nsls email. Sometime after this, both the email and signature reflected the new HLP name in communications from you. XXXX and HLP use the same address, and this is also proof they are the same company. 

They sent me a copy of an official White House Press Release about student loan programs, and stated that they worked hand in hand with the Department of Education. They told me it was very important to use their address and not my own. Changed the name of their company during the time I was with them and never formally let me know which seems very deceptive. This company also guaranteed a reduction of my payment by 65 %. No one ever told me that the Direct Consolidation process was free to do on my own, or that by going through it that I would lose all my years of paying them to add towards my PSLF for being an educator. 

This company told me to ignore XXXX because they ( HLP ) were my new loan servicer. They also reported my tax filing status wrongfully in order to get a lower payment. This company pulled payments of {$29.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and told me that I had to make these payments to stay on the federal loan programs they had supposedly gotten me on. I found out later that these were just fees to their company and did not go toward my student loans. 

They repeatedly said that they were part of a FEDERAL GUARANTEED LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. They did not disclose that they were just third-party companies and call centers, filling out applications I could have done on my own for free. By the way, my credit report shows that I always make my payments to every account I have. I paid {$990.00} upfront because I trusted a handful of lies thinking I was doing what was best for me and my family regarding my student loans. I am demanding a full refund of all monies paid, via cashiers check addressed to me. 

The total amount due from the {$990.00} and {$29.00} ( to stay on the program ) payments is : {$2100.00}. I will not accept a XXXX less. ( Monthly payments from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I filed a XXXX  complaint containing proof of the above mentioned practices and deception, and they lied and denied things that I literally have proof of ( in included emails ).

09/07/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Navient, my student loan provider, is known for harmful and deceptive practices that have resulted in several lawsuits starting in XXXX according to XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Please add changing Federal Loans to private loans to avoid the CARES Act mandate, overcharging repayment amounts on the Income Based Repayment Plan, refusing to respond to emailed requests, charging unauthorized fees, engaging in deceptive communication techniques, and engaging in harassing and retaliatory actions to these harmful practices. 

Changing Federal Loans to Private Status I have 11 student loans to cover finishing getting my XXXX  and XXXX  degrees. The first one was opened on XX/XX/XXXX and the last one was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. I graduated with my XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. All these loans were opened under Sallie Mae and were XXXX, subsidized and unsubsidized Federal Loans ( please see the Sallie Mae Repayment Plan Selection and Summary from XX/XX/XXXX ). When these loans were sold to Navient in XXXX, Navient also agreed they were Federal Loans and not Private, please see pages 1 and 4, Section 9, Definitions of the Income Driven Repayment Plan Request, which is also attached.

From 2015 to XX/XX/XXXX, my payment on the Income Based Repayment plan was just the payment. In XXXX of XXXX, my loan was placed in deferment because I was unemployed. When Navient took my loans out of deferment status in XXXX of XXXX, my payment of {$74.00} included an additional monthly fee of {$11.00}. That is when my Navient changed my Federal to a Private loan to avoid the CARES Act mandate. According to Senator XXXX office, the service fees are only assigned to private loans. 

It appears that Navient knew my loan was a Federal loan because deferment is only for 12 months, yet Navient let the loan remain in deferment until XX/XX/XXXX, which is 16 months, which seems to imply that Navient was going to let my loans stay in deferment and then changed their minds in XX/XX/XXXX Current Payment on Income Based Repayment Plan I am at a loss at what Navient is doing, especially since they are not replying to emails. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Navient saying my new IBR monthly payment, starting on XX/XX/XXXX would be {$76.00}, however, when I went online to pay my XXXX XXXX, Navient posted that my XX/XX/XXXX payment would be {$220.00}, plus a fee of {$11.00}. ( This when I tried to resolve this issue with a Navient supervisor and ended up talking with Senator XXXX office. ) Since contacting the Senators office, President Biden and the FSA Ombudsman, Navient changed the amount due to {$220.00}, less the ONE service fee of {$11.00}. Does the mean that Navient realized they shouldnt have charged service fees for 9 months? If so, doesnt it make sense that Navient should refund {$100.00}, instead of just {$11.00}? And doesnt this mean that Navient acknowledges that my loans were not private, but Federal? And if so, they are supposed to be in deferment? 

If Navient is going to acknowledge that the fees were charged in error, then next payment due after XX/XX/XXXX, after the deferment ends would be {$76.00}, less {$100.00}. Which would {$0.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX and {$46.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

No Response to Emails and Deceptive and Hostile Verbal Communication Communication with Navient has been unsuccessful. They dont respond to emails left on their website. I left emails in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX asking what the additional monthly fees of {$11.00} were for, but didnt get a response, until after I contacted the FSA Ombudsmans office, Then, I got a very hostile phone response in the summer. The woman who called me was so hostile in her tone, that it made my stomach upset and she refused to let me speak to her supervisor. I left an email on their website on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX and it is now Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and no response. The generic message on their website says they reply within 2 business days. It has been 5 business days since my last email. 

Speaking with Navient representatives is a frustrating process as they use unfair fighting techniques like being inconsistent which is defined as keeping the caller off balance by changing the focus of the issue, brown bagging which is bringing up issues that dont relate to the solving the issue at hand, blame and straight out lying. Examples of these communications styles are as follows : - On XXXX, I spoke with a Navient supervisor who said my loans had never been in deferment from XXXX to XXXX, which made me wonder if he was really looking at my account. He also said because my loans were Private Loan and not Federal, it were not eligible for deferment. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, I spoke with someone from Navient who first, got mad at me when I interchanged you and Navient. Obviously, when I said You, I meant the corporate You, yet she took it personally and said, Stop accusing me of that She also said that my loans were not eligible for deferment because I had been paying on them, which was nonsensical. Of course, I was paying on them, Navient took it out of deferment! Just because I was doing the right thing and paying it, doesnt make it right that Navient took it out of deferment when they shouldnt have. She also said that even though my loans were Federal, they were not eligible for deferment because they were taken out before XXXX. So, there are some Navient employees who see that my loans are Federal and others that tell the Federal Student Loan Association, that my loans are Private. And again, my loans prior to XXXX, were with Sallie Mae, not Navient, I didnt start with Navient until XXXX. 

Charging Incorrect Amounts on Repayment Plan In addition, Navient has not been charging me the correct amount on my Income Based Repayment Plan. Per page 4, the definitions of what is calculated for a monthly payment on the Income Driven Repayment Plan Request, 15 % of discretionary income is allowed. The 15 % of discretionary income is the amount that exceeds ones adjusted gross income that exceeds 150 % of the poverty guidelines for ones state and family size. As you can see by the chart below, I was overcharged by {$110.00} per month in XXXX, {$35.00} per month in XXXX, and {$23.00} per month in XXXX. In XXXX, they undercharged me by {$77.00}. ( Please see the attached chart Chart of Incorrect Payments for IBR ) I can provide copies of bank statements to prove my payments upon request. How can I do business with a student loan servicing company that cant even calculate the annual IBR payment correctly?

According to Navients website, my current payment is {$220.00}. It should be noted that the 150 % above the poverty level doesnt accurately represent what a persons discretionary income is in the Seattle/metro area, where the cost of living is so much higher than elsewhere in the state. In fact, there is an additional chart called the Wx or Weatherization Chart, which gives a more accurate representation of how much is the actual discretionary income a person in the XXXX area might have. In my case that amount is {$2900.00} for 200 % of poverty or {$3400.00} for 60 % of the mean income. Using those numbers to calculate how much my monthly payment would be, my new payment would be {$110.00} or {$32.00}, depending on which number one used. Either of these numbers would fit my budget much better than {$220.00}, plus fees, which I can not afford. Therefore, I ask that Navient be required to use the Wx Chart when determining monthly payments, because they are more in line when considering the high cost of living in the XXXX area. 

Harassing and Retaliatory Action In addition, Navient is now engaging in harassing and retaliatory action because I have sought help from Senator XXXX, President Biden and FSA Ombudsman. My XX/XX/XXXX payment is 7 days late. I received two phone calls asking for payment, one at XXXX XXXX  and one at XXXX XXXX  and I spoke with both callers. In the past, Navient would only call on a past due bill if it was over 30 days and it is against the law for companies to call demanding payment more than once a day. 

Conclusion In conclusion, I believe the documentation shows that my 11 student loans are Federal loans and not private, as Navient is claiming. I believe that Navient took my loans out of deferment early, in XX/XX/XXXX, and changed the loans from Federal to private at that time. Navient will not respond to my emails within their 2 business day response time. And are arbitrarily adding and subtracting service fees for no apparent reason. When I do speak to Navient representatives, they lie, are hostile and/or are deceptive. From XXXX to XXXX, Navient has not charged correct payments, per the Income Based Repayment Plan. And Navient is engaging in harassing and retaliatory actions, since I have sought help because Navient changed my Federal loans to private.

What I am seeking. I believe that changing my Federal loans to a private loans and charging incorrect amounts that were not in line with the Income Based Repayment Plan are illegal practices and violate the conditions of loan ; therefore, I believe the loans should be completely forgiven. In addition, Navient not responding to emails either verbally or a written format, and verbally lying, being hostile and being deceptive when I call to speak to them, makes doing business with Navient impossible. The retaliatory and harassing actions of Navient, because I sought help are also in violation of business practices. In short, Navient has irreparably ruined this business relationship and I demand that Navient forgive all outstanding balances.

She had left several messages of my phone in the 7 days prior, but I had not picked up. Anyways, on this day, I spoke with her and she described that she was with a third party company that could help transfer my loans from XXXX XXXX to the US Department of Education. In addition, Students First would help get me enrolled into Public Service Loan Forgiveness if I was eligible, and lastly after 4 monthly payments of approximately {$250.00}, reduce my monthly payments to around {$50.00} per month for the duration of my 10 year loan repayment. I was extremely suspicious from the outset, but XXXX XXXX had taken around 8 months to process the eligibility of my employer for PSFL, which was extremely frustrating, so I thought this might be a good option to hear out. The counselor was aggressive about having me pay for the first payment that day, and I continued to have my reservations. I told her I would call her back, so that I could look online about the legitimacy of this company. They had a website, the counselor seemed to be knowledgable, and I really was anxious to get started on making payments that would count towards PSLF. I called XXXX XXXX back and asked her to clarify what Students First role was and how it would help. While still at work on XX/XX/XXXX, I ended up signing a service agreement with Students First and making the first payment of {$250.00} over the phone. All the while, I continued to have trepidation about the interaction and the speed with which it occurred. Over the next several days, I emailed the information they requested including PSLF form ( which I already submitted to XXXX XXXX ), paycheck stub, and XXXX  tax return. I called XXXX XXXX at the phone number provided to confirm receipt of those documents, and she confirmed. One month later on XX/XX/XXXX, I continued to have my doubts as to the legitimacy of this company and how they fit into the XXXX no longer being a student loans servicer. I decided to email XXXX XXXX a simple question about a Perkins Loan, and the email was immediately returned to me. My stomach sank, as it began to set in that this probably was a scam.

I recently pulled my credit report from your XXXX and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 90 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as well as 120 days in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and 150 days late on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I immediately disputed this information with NAVIENT and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

06/01/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am contacting you because I noticed that Navient has significantly extended the payoff date of each of my federal loans ( and significantly increased the total payoff amount of each of them ) after I opted in to the COVID-19 administrative forbearance. After deciding to take advantage of the administrative forbearance in XX/XX/2021, I noticed that payoff schedules for all of my loans were significantly extended, resulting in much larger total payments. For example, there is one loan for which I should have 18 more months left of payment ( or 24 months if I include the forbearance period ) and for which I owe around {$2600.00}. However, my account now reflects that I have 32 more months of repayment resulting in a total of nearly {$4600.00}. Another one, in which I should have 12 more months of repayment ( 18 if counting the forebearance ), now shows a payment schedule of 25 more months. The total balance on that loan should be around {$2100.00} but the new payment schedule would have me paying {$5600.00}. 

Similar discrepancies are reflected on all of my federal loans serviced by Navient. There is no reason that this should be the case given I was paying all of the loans consistently up until XX/XX/2021, had already paid off interest on the affected loans, and those loans have been on a 0 % interest rate for over a year now due to the COVID-19 emergency relief measures.

I requested that these errors in my estimated payoff schedules be corrected and received three different responses from three different Navient representatives. None of the responses is satisfactory. I spoke to one specialist on the phone who stated that my loan terms had changed since I had changed my payment plan ; however, my payment plan has been the same for several years. Another specialist who replied to a written complaint said that Navient would not be able to update my account and reflect the proper payoff schedule while my loans were in the administrative forbearance. This doesn't make sense as it would mean that Navient effectively stops servicing the loans by providing up-to-date information on their status during this period. And a final one indicated that postponing my payments would inherently extend my projected payoff date, resulting in a higher payoff amount. However, that response doesn't explain why the loans would be extended for multiple times longer than the requested forbearance period, with the result being several thousands of dollars inexplicably added on to the total amount due.

I wanted to report my concerns around this development since the inaccurate information impacts my eligibility for an employer-paid loan repayment program that I participate in. I also recognize that I am uniquely able to track these bizarre changes because of the record keeping that I do for that program. I suspect that other borrowers would not have historical information about their loans that would enable them to see how dramatically and arbitrarily their payoff estimates have increased just by moving their loans into the administrative forbearance from one day to the next.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MA,02138,None,Consent provided,Web,06/01/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4421763

This number is XXXX. Phone records will indicate I have a XXXX area code phone number. I am originally from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX but currently live in XXXXXXXX XXXX Listening to the 48 second voicemail, it was not someone from back home. It was Navient calling to try to get a payment out of me. Navient and personal banking records indicate {$150.00} payment was made in XXXX with emphasis towards most delinquent loans. This indicates the company is spoofing numbers with the intent to obtain anything of value. Under FCC laws that is illegal. I then received a restricted phone call : It was Navient again. When asked why they used a XXXX number she said it was the address they have on file. Wrong they have a XXXX  address on file. Last month they sent in certified mail a copy of my promissory notes. Then she said the company is based in that area. Wrong again. The company 's address listed on certified mail is po box XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX address with a XXXX area code. This is also the address on file with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Then I heard kids in the background and questioned why I was hearing things in the background and she hung up. Also, according to President Joe Biden, a freeze on federal loans was extended in XXXX through the end of XX/XX/XXXX. My federal loans are in Navient as well. Part of a repayment program I signed up for, my federal loans were consolidated into my private loans. So, this leaves the question if my federal loans are attached to my private loans then shouldn't I also receive a freeze on having to make payments through the end of XXXX?

I immediately disputed this information with NELNET LNS and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

I was informed there are 24 months worth of payments made to my first loan services that must be manually processed 2. I was informed that the reason 84 payments failed to qualify for public loan forgiveness is because of a system incongruity AKA- system error. Therefore, those 84 payments must also be manually processed.

3. The reason those 84 payments were denied for the student loan forgiveness program is for being in an ineligible payment plan. According to the terms of the TEPSLS program, the information is incorrect- since being in a graduated repayment plan IS an eligible one under TEPSLS.

10/06/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear Sir or Madam, 1. DPT ED/NAVI Account XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 120 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I immediately disputed this information with DPT ED/NAVI and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX, advising me that although I satisfied all admission requirements for the XXXX program that I had not been selected based on their ranking system based on their admission exam scores and due to more applicants applying that they had spots for. On XX/XX/XXXX I got an email from XXXX XXXX the XXXX program chair to call her because I was next in line to be admitted to the XXXX program. During my meeting with the admission staff, I was rushed through the process of applying for federal student loans, never given the answer as to the the total cost of the program ( even though I asked for the total program costs ), and I was pressured to sign the paperwork if I wanted to get in now because they could offer the spot to someone else. Classes started XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any enrollment packet that outline what's required to graduate. I was not given or ever shown the XXXX XXXX note until after classes had started. I did not electronically sign anything & only ever signed financial loan papers once when I went in to sign up for school. I attended XXXX XXXX with the understanding that all of my loans were federal only to find out later that a high interest private loan had been attached to my package without my knowledge. I was also required to pay {$1800.00} cash out of pocket because I refused to take out another loan.

I went in this morning and my loan document was changed to match what they were saying my start date of my interest was due. I guess they can go in and just change the terms of the loan. I guess they went in after my complaint to match what they were saying and basically changed the loan document after I had signed the other documents that I have on hand.

In XXXX after I graduated I started looking for options to refinance as a lot of people do. I managed to get a great offer from Prodigy Finance. Back in the days I did not have many options as I was an international student on a work visa. They gave me a great rate, advertised as all the rest of the student loan refinance companies, refinanced my US student loan. 
3 years later, today, I am trying to refinance my loan again in the US. I am still working and living here. What I am coming to find out is that no US institution ( as least the 6 different ones that I talked to that refinance student loans- XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) will refinance that student loan as Prodigy Finance is based in XXXX. 
I am stuck with a huge loan ( {$130000.00} ), high interest rate ( 5.62 % ), a lifetime change event ( had a baby ) that requires me to have more disposable income. All because Prodigy Finance did not disclose/advise this kind of information that because they are XXXX based one can not refinance the loan back in the US. A reasonable 30 year something person won't even know that this is a thing and that you need to ask this questions. They are a company that are refinancing US student loans for people living in the US. It is reasonable to assume that you should be able later to refinance your loan in US. I consider this to be highly misleading and fraudulent. They don't refinance their own loans, they don't want to renegotiate the terms and extend the term. 

I consider myself quite educated and financially verse. But a normal person won't ever assume that they won't be able to refinance their loan in the US if this is not explicitly stipulated somewhere in the contract or advertisement. 

I don't know if you can help me with anything with that and figure out my situation. But PLEASE make something about this company to proactively disclose this information to it's potential borrowers as people are STUCK with them and there is nothing you can do but pay the loan until you pay it off.

Then in XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter stating that they are postponing loan payments due to recent pandemic, until XX/XX/XXXX. 

Current XXXX XXXX : After spending 2 hours on the phone with them, I made a payment of {$100.00} and {$220.00} in XXXX to get them off my back. The {$220.00} payment will be monthly until XX/XX/XXXX. Explaining to them I would pay the loan off but now my credit score has dropped 200 points.

I was able to get a home equity loan to pay them 60 % of the total loans ( 4 loans now ) which is the first time that they explained to me that this was an option. They never offered me this before. The total loan amount is {$91000.00}. I was to borrow {$55000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called them to get the processes started to pay this off. First the agent ( XXXX ) went over the process telling me I needed to give them my bank routing number and when the payment would be coming out of my account. She refused to send me a letter first stating that this would remove my name for this loan. When I told her "" fine '' she acted like she was reading something and said "" no, the amount is now XXXX ''. I have the whole conversation recorded. She had previously stated the amount of {$54000.00}. At that time I told them "" no "" and to withdraw the upcoming monthly payments. I can't afford to keep paying a company that changes the agreement every time I speak with them. I have no idea what to do at this point.

10/05/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Hi there, I had both my federal and state taxes illegally docked despite there being a moratorium per the Cares Act until XX/XX/XXXX. The department of Education actually sent me a letter saying payments were paused. I had roughly {$7300.00} taken that I need returned. I'm a single mother of XXXX kids XXXX with no financial help and am facing utility shut off notices and threats for my car being repo-ed. I was an XXXX XXXX  until COVID hit and my oldest is at XXXX XXXX  with his extreme XXXX, with our doctor highly suggesting I not resume interacting with the public until things settle down. My PUA ( self-employment UI ) just ended and this money is very needed right now to keep my family afloat. 


I was directed by Health and Human Services to call OSU for assistance with my debt and did so numerous times over the years, seeking forbearance or any sort of help. Each time I am told that they are private loans so there's no help. I do not understand how I had to go entrance and exit online counseling to get the loans and I signed up for student loans, not private. They say that when I dropped down to part time it changed to private? I do not understand how a loan can change like that. I have all of the emails from the time of origination and they all say "" student loan ''. They're also having me pay back grants, which is weird. Further, to my understanding, private loans can't be docked unless there's a judgement. So I don't understand how they've ever been docked from my state. And they say that they did request that payments not be docked but it wasn't until XXXX and my payment arrived in XXXX. I do not believe they can not offer a reversal due to financial hardship during a pandemic. Additionally, I was never told that I had a whole separate loan that's federal. To my knowledge, the initial amount owed was XXXX and I've paid that back and then some over the years with my taxes being docked. It's hard for me to believe that over the years that I asked for help, they never bothered to tell me that part of my loan was federal and that I could actually get forbearance or some kind of help from federal. I honestly don't believe that they don't have any type of programs for their loans themselves though. I've never heard of such a thing. No forgiveness, loan discharge, or consolidation, repayment options? I feel they're taking advantage of me and I'd like my loan discharged at this point. As I've been looking into this, I'm seeing that they're legally required to provide me statements and repayment options, of which they've done neither. Reading that Department of Education says states can hold student loan servicers accountable when they fail to provide eligibility of forgiveness programs or provide false/misleading info on account. The loans were from 2009 so if they're private, the private should have maybe dropped off?

I would like my payments to both OSU and federal returned. The servicer that docked payment for federal is Credit Adjustments Collection Company : XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are not returning my calls.

06/22/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My complaint revolves around the severe financial, personal, and career consequences I incurred due to false and misleading information provided to me by Texas Guaranteed. For years I was making payment on loans of about $ XXXX with a monthly payment of {$300.00}. Around late XXXX I started falling behind as I received a severe paycut at my job of about 20 % due to loss of bonus at XXXX XXXX contacted Texas Guaranteed numerous times and each time they said I had already exhausted all options and there was nothing I could do. I was still paying though even if late. Eventually I could not keep up and tried to find another solution as lates were starting to impact my credit rating. No one ever returned my call. A few months went by and I finally gathered a few XXXX dollars by selling off personal belongings. I called to try and make payments and I was denied. They wanted ALL payments that were past due. This was not possible as I had just a few XXXX not thousands of dollars available. As a consequence I was advised to wait a few months because they had another solution for me. Their "" solution '' come to find out in late XX/XX/XXXX was that they had filed for a WAGE Garnishment! They immediately started taking {$650.00} per month which was over XXXX my regular payment of {$300.00}. I called again pleading for help. They said this was the only route to reinstate a good standing and then conned me for MORE money. They said I had to pay another {$120.00} per month penalty as well. So all in for almost a year they took $ XXXX per MONTH. As previously advised I was already lacking enough funds prior to any of this. This lead to defaulting on all my credit cards as I simply didnt even have any money after rent and student loans and barely any food to eat. After a year they stated congrats you are back on track, we will remove garnishment. However they had ADDED nearly $ XXXX as a "" Collection Fee '', So aside from wrecking havoc to my credit forcing me to default, losing XXXX lbs due to near starvation, losing apartment and living in my XXXX they ADDED $ XXXX after I had already been garnished/paid nearly $ XXXX! This damage continues to this day. My student loan is now being serviced by another but it reflects an XXXX of over 130 %. This loan has been negatively amortizing even though Ive been paying for nearly XXXX decades!!! I need all this investigated, fees/penalties removed, lates corrected and compensation for ancillary impacts such as credit decline, increased cost of borrowing, homelessness ( due to forced garnish ), and overall lying and stealing tens of thousands from me. 

A previous response ignored all my questions, concerns, and allegations. I am very well aware of how a loan amortizes and dont need a lesson there. I want answers as to WHY I was continually lied to, misled, and misguided. Their direction led to me being placed in this position. Their wrongdoings caused me severe financial, credit, and mental impacts. These impacts have been compounded since then. Just as the interest has compounded due to the addition of the collection fee due to their purposeful misdirection. Please provide EVIDENCE of the contrary, pull the call recordings, the notations, and my written confirmations. If you are not able to provide this, then XXXX demand restitution, the fees removed, the compounded interest removed, and additional compensation for the ancillary impacts that at this moment are incalculable. If you cant calculate it then please advise me so that I seek legal counsel. This is the last opportunity I am providing to make this right for me before I present this to our multiple media outlets and newly elected officials that see the new form of slavery that is student loan debt and the malicious behavior of the master servicers that only give direction in their best interest.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Texas Guaranteed,TX,78251,None,Consent provided,Web,06/22/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4482187

09/08/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am submitting a complaint onFedLoan Servicing due to unfair status claims regardingPublic Student Loan Forgiveness qualifying payments and the extremely slow process of reviewing my current employment status. 

1. Payment and PSLF : In XX/XX/XXXX, I felt that I should be getting close to repayment numbers that would allow me to qualify for Public Student Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). When delving into my accounts I noticed that there were an inordinateamount of "" Your payment was received outside of payment period window '' flags on payments over the years ( see files 1-2 ). As someone that is not a late payer on anything ( I have an over XXXX credit score ) I was instantly shocked to see so many of those. So, on XX/XX/XXXX I started an online chat with someone at FedLoan Servicing. As you can see in the chat transcripts ( file 3 ) the staff member, XXXX, acknowledged that some of the "" late payments '' were not late at all but simply short a small amount of money most likely due to a billing error ( Why would I pay $ .1- {$5.00} short of a bill that is hundreds of dollars if not a billing error? ). She said that she would make note and get the {$.00} changed to qualifying but couldn't do that for the ones that are more than that ( even though, as mentioned, it was most likely pulled from a previously paid bill already ). Again, I am unclear as to why their billing issues result in my not qualifying for payments properly. That is incredibly unfair and feels manipulative. Also, it has been well over a month since I spoke with XXXX and none of those {$.00} "" late '' payments have been changed to qualifying payments. 
2. Reviewing Employment Status : Also listed in the chat ( file 3 ) you can see that I asked about my updated employment information so that the current months can also qualify towards PSLF. I know they spoke to my boss on the phone toconfirm that I still work there so I'm not sure what the hold up is otherwise. I have also continued to work for the same employerfor eleven years now anyway. I fear that they are purposely dragging their feet during the forbearance time and I am incredibly frustrated. 

Lastly, I have received word that FedLoan Servicing will cease being my loan provider in the coming months. A new service provider potentially comes with a new interface, new processes, and I fear that my information and previous complaints/requests will be lost in the shuffle of transferring to a new company. I would like these problems solved as soon as possible and before the service is switched to a new company.",None,AES/PHEAA,MO,63105,None,Consent provided,Web,09/08/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4703498

Sallie Mae refused to remove me from the two additional loans stating that as I had signed for the first loan I was then committed as a co-signer to all future loans. This is deeply concerning as based on Sallie Maes logic they would hold me responsible for any future loans as well without disclosure or consent to the amount co-signed.

( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.

Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( XXXX XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( XXXX ( b ) ( XXXX ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

I called XXXX on XX/XX/21 and the representative stated that Aspire does not have to follow the mandatory automatic postponement of repayments that the President and Department of Education put in place from XXXX and that I had to apply for assistance. I have federal student loans, not private loans or other loan types that may be exempt from this relief bill. Aspire should not be denying us this right.

I though this was odd, since month after month during this Coronavirus pause on payments, my other lender, XXXX XXXX, did not communicate with me, no requests for payment, etc. at all. Yet Navient sent me emails a few per month that reminded me to make my payment. I made payments each month and on a phone call to them in the Fall of XXXX, I asked about why they are still seeking payments from me each month, I was told "" yes, we are '' and I asked if they are still charging interest, and I was told "" yes '' by the representative from Navient that I talked to. I just received another reminder this month, XX/XX/XXXX, when payments on Federal Loans are paused, to make my payment to Navient. I am including the email copy below. It seems to me that Navient is willfully disregarding this Federal Government mandate on how they should be operating. and insisting on payment and charging interest during this Coronavirus pause : Note : I am requesting that Navient reverse all interest charged during the Coronavirus period of Federal payment pause and apply all my payments during this Coronavirus period to my principal on my smallest loan and respond back in writing or email to me confirming that the payments have been applied to the principal on my {$8700.00} loan and that all interest has been reversed.

Over several years, I have tried to lower my payments but they have always been calculated over {$500.00} a month rising to over {$800.00} a month based on my household income. ( See email dates XX/XX/XXXX. I was unemployed for several years and there was absolutely no way I could pay these amounts and was advised to either request a deferment or a forebearance rather than Navient offering or accepting a more reasonable payment amount of around {$250.00} a month. As I watched my student loans skyrocket, I decided to work for a non-profit/public service company in XXXX as a way to qualify for the Loan Forgiveness Program. 

Over the years, as I called every 9 months or so to ask for help but was pointed in the direction of extending my forbearance. ( 5-10 ) I was never advised about the Loan Forgiveness Program or offered a more reasonable monthly payment based on my family household income. It wasn't until XXXX when a representative advised me to file separate income taxes in order to qualify for a lower month payment bracket which by the way, has caused additional tax issues. Where I find myself now is settling on working in a low paying job although I took out my student loan to obtain an XXXX. My hope is that my student loans will be forgiven in 4-5 more years. 

More concerning now is that my non-profit I work for does not provide health benefits and with my husband retiring next year, we will be forced to find a healthcare program that may be extremely expensive or I must find another non-profit that offers health benefits. What I am also concerned about is that after all of this sacrificing, my non-profit/public service work may not qualify.

I was surprised, from seeing how much my payment jumped in a short time, and I knew the payment would be too much for me because I just started a new job and was not making enough money to cover it and my expenses at the same time. I called my student loan servicer to weigh my options. They informed of the options and I thought that forbearance would be the best option at the time. They told me that my interest would capitalize. I can not recall if they mentioned how much that would be.

06/16/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"I am currently enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. I have submitted my employment certification ( have worked at the same public state higher education institution as XXXX XXXX for over 5 years ) and been rejected several times. Each time, the reasons are the manner in which the form has been submitted by either me or my employer. Each time I have called and my employer have called and we have made the adjustments as instructed. Each time I have been rejected. The last payments that were certified were from XX/XX/XXXX. Since that time I have submitted Employment Certification and received letters rejecting my certification claims on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In that time my certified qualifying payments toward my PSLF has remained at 49 of 120 qualifying payments and 50 of 120 qualifying payments. The Fed Loan Servicing PSLF calculator lists 27 payments as "" employment not certified '' when they should be added to my total qualifying payments since my employment is qualified for PSLF and we have made multiple attempts to qualify my employment ( see previous dates ). 

This is not the first time I have had to make a complaint against Fed Loan Servicing for this same issue. The last time my employment was certified it was the result of a similar complaint I have lodged with the CFPB. This is a recurring issue for Fed Loan Servicing. I demand my employment be certified as myself and my employer have been instructed using the tools and existing submissions of employment certification that we have made. The direct instruction and support given to us by the Fed Loan Servicing working on behalf of the Dept of Education is inadequate.",None,AES/PHEAA,FL,33304,None,Consent provided,Web,06/16/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4464786
07/28/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am currently in the PSLF program to have two of my student loans forgiven. I have obtained a "" qualifying '' status on 117 of the 120 payments required to achieve loan forgiveness. I completed the 120 necessary qualifying payments in XX/XX/XXXX, so there are only 3 payments on my loans that need to be certified as "" qualifying '' before my forgiveness can be approved. The payments are for XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, I am only employed by my qualifying employer until XX/XX/XXXX. If my loan forgiveness is not approved by that date, I will not receive the forgiveness I have been working towards for the past decade. Therefore it is crucial that these remaining 3 payments are certified as "" qualifying '' and my loan forgiveness is received in the next 30 days. 

To that end, I submitted a PSLF application request directly after my XX/XX/XXXX payment date passed, which was as soon as I was able to submit it. At the time I submitted my application, there were 21 payments on my account that had not yet been deemed "" qualifying, '' despite the fact that I had submitted an employment certification back in XX/XX/XXXX. 

After receiving an automated response that my application had been received and was being considered, I submitted a request for expedited consideration around XX/XX/XXXX. I received a response from FedLoan Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my PSLF application was currently under review to determine if I had been working for a qualifying employer for the required payment period. The response also stated that had I used the PSLF tool on the Dept. of Education website to apply for forgiveness that I might have received an automatic approval, but because I didn't do that, my application required a live representative to review it. 

But I did use the PSLF tool to submit my application! However, the tool did not recognize that I had made 99 qualifying payments that had already been deemed as qualifying! My current employer is also listed in the PSLF tool database as an approved qualifying employer, so the forgiveness decision should be quick and simple, as the remaining 21 payments that had not yet been deemed "" qualifying '' when I submitted my application were made while I was employed at that employer. 

I am also discouraged because this week the results of my XX/XX/XXXX employment certification suddenly appeared on my PSLF payment tracking page. So, it took over 4 months for FedLoan Servicing to determine that my payments made between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were "" qualifying, '' despite the fact that my employer is already in their database as a qualified employer for PSLF purposes. What is baffling is why the representative reviewing my file did not also review my PSLF application at the same time they were reviewing my XX/XX/XXXX certification request. It simply makes no sense, considering my forgiveness application had been submitted for nearly a month! 

Additionally, several years ago, the only way I was able to receive a response from FedLoan Servicing about my qualifying payments ( after attempting multiple times over 2 years ) was to file a CFPB complaint. I received my requested response in about 10 days after filing my complaint. 

In summary, I am in dire need of assistance with expediting my PSLF application to get the final 3 payments ( out of the 120 required payments ) classified as "" qualifying '' and then get the loan forgiveness granted as soon as possible, but for sure before XX/XX/XXXX.

Was told that I was eligible for a Forebearance and was on one fromXX/XX/XXXX throughXX/XX/XXXX Was sent letters about the Forebearance expiring but if I was still having difficulty making payments due to COVID to call and inquire about further assistance. Was told back in XXXX that I was not under the federal program since this loan did not qualify under the recently passed CARES Act but they would submit my request via phone to do a Natural Disaster Forbearance Extension which was the original plan fromXX/XX/XXXX I received a letter dated oXX/XX/XXXXthat I was no longer eligible regardless of COVID so I called back in to see what relief I could get since my wife was still unemployed. Was told again that they would submit a repayment plan option and see if that would work and received an email on XX/XX/XXXX about the COVID related Forebearance may be ending soon???. I called back in and they stated again that they would submit my request via phone. Shortly after I received notification that my credit score dropped 50 point sand was reported 60 days past due by AES. Called back in to AES and spoke with a rep about disputing the credit reporting as well as eligibility for a 90 extension as part of the COVID situation. Was told to keep checking the website over the next 7 days to see the status of the relief program and at one point saw that here was no payment due. 
Received a denial letter on XX/XX/XXXX about the credit dispute ad just received an email stating that I'm now more than 90 days past due and I still owe the current monthly payment. THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY AS TO WHAT YOU ARE BE BEING TOLD OVER THE PHONE AND THE SPOOTY ELECTRONIC COMMUNCIATION THEY POST ON THE SITE OTR SEND VIA EMAIL.

10/06/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear Sir or Madam, 1. NELNET LNS Account Number:XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 120 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as well as 150 days late in XX/XX/XXXX. 


I immediately disputed this information with NELNET LNS and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

I have contacted FedLoan on XX/XX/XXXX and disputed contradictory letters I have received ; FedLoan Servicing never responded. 

I contacted FedLoan via chat XX/XX/XXXX to understand how my payments were calculated towards the PSLF/TEPSLF programs. I requested a review of a number of payments that were incorrectly marked as ineligible for the TEPSLF. It would appear I should be eligible to apply XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX as no updates had been made to my account. They informed me it could take up to 90 days for the review to be completed. On this date of contact, 105 days had passed. 

I submitted an application for forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter stating I had only made XXXX payments towards the TEPSLF program. However, all of the payments since my previous employer certification from XX/XX/XXXX to the current date were not included, adding an additional 9 payments, bringing my total to 119 payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, FedLoan contacted me via phone and informed me that if I resubmitted my application on XX/XX/XXXX or later, I would meet the 120 qualifying payments. 

My application was resubmitted and received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a letter confirming I had made 120 qualifying payments for the TEPSLF program. My account was also updated to reflect I met the 120 qualifying payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a letter stating I was ineligible for forgiveness under the TEPSLF program as I only had 110 payments. It is impossible for my payment count to still be 110 6 months later when I meet the criteria. 

I have not changed my qualifying employer in over 9 years and previously worked at a qualifying employer ( all of which has been verified by FedLoan ). 

I am asking you the CFPB to contact FedLoan Servicing and get FedLoan to fix this and forgive my loan as I have submitted my application, meet the criteria, and have surpassed the number of qualifying payments.

10/08/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I have private student loans with Navient. These loans were taken out in XXXX with XXXX XXXX which was eventually sold to Navient. Over the years we have had issues with the way payments were being allocated, payments are taken out before the date they were supposed to which caused overdrafts as well as payments being taken out and still getting charged late fees when on autopay. I requested all documentation from Navient from the beginning of my loan so I could cross-reference these issues. Since i have 4 loans with them it has been a difficult and time-consuming process. I have found many discrepancies in the documents from their system which they personally sent me via mail and what the website shows in terms of the amount of debt owed, payment allocation, and late fees. I have collected bank statements dating back from XXXX and cross-referenced their documents on payments made ; I found at least 5 instances where payments were withdrawn from the bank but never posted to my loans! This in turn caused unnecessary late fees! I was on payment programs for over a year and still charged late fees sometimes on the same day payment was withdrawn or a few days later. I have spoken to numerous people at navient about these issues and no one could give me an answer as to why this happened. I was told that since some of these issues occurred years ago they couldn't do anything about it and checking the details would take to long. I was also told that they could not give me answers unless i had a lawyer contact them. I also asked them why their records were different from what the website showed in terms of the amount of debt owed and they said something to the effect of the system allowing for a {$10.00} give or take difference but in my research, there were occasions where the difference was far greater than {$10.00}. I also created a spreadsheet to check if i was being charged correct interest and asked how to correctly find the interest for each month, none of the people i spoke with could provide me with correct information. I read the promissory note and came up with a spreadsheet to try to get the amounts they provided, i was able to get those numbers up until a certain period before the numbers no longer matched with what they had. I have contacted the Attorney General in Pennsylvania who is currently suing Navient for these issues and for a time they were CC in my emails with Navient investigating these issues. Unfortunately, i have not been able to speak with anyone in the attorney general 's office about this. I am desperately trying to find a pro-bono lawyer who could help me with these issues because i am in no way financially capable of paying. I am hoping to file for undue hardship in bankruptcy as well for I am over {$110000.00} in debt to navient for private student loans. In XXXX I was told by one of their representatives that people with as much debt I owe don't deserve to have a life when i was begging for lowered payments.

7 ) XXXX, EMPLOYEE ID : XXXX, stated : "" It was not approved, because THE PAYMENT PERIOD of my current IDR payment of {$55.00} WAS EXTENDED TO XX/XX/XXXX, or to the NEXT YEAR. 
8 ) I asked XXXX, EMPLOYEE ID : XXXX, if she will send me a LETTER WITH THE SAME STATEMENT. XXXX, EMPLOYEE ID : XXXX stated a FedLoanServicing Letter should be arriving up to 10 days.

12 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a VERY UNCLEAR AND CONFUSING LETTER FROM FEDLOANSERVISING.

The reasons below will detail what actions you need to take so we can continue processing your request.

03/22/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I applied for student loan forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program ( PSLFP ) and was denied the loan forgiveness ( XX/XX/XXXX ). It turns out my loans were ineligible. However, I was never given the information that my loans were ineligible even when I spoke with my student loan provider Navient in XXXX when the program began and in XXXX when I called them to switch to an income repayment program and told them I was working towards forgiveness on the PSLFP I was not told, nor could find any information at that time, that FFELP loans were not eligible and the repayment plans I had been on prior to XXXX and after XXXX would never make me eligible for this program. On XX/XX/XXXX when I called Navient after being denied PSLF by the Dept. of Education, that is when they then told me my loans were ineligible. Nothing on my account summary or information of my loans on their site ever said my loans were through the FFELP. Onluy after my call on XX/XX/XXXX did they switch the description of my student loans on my account summary on the online portal. Prior to XX/XX/XXXX it just listed them as "" consolidation ''. After XX/XX/XXXX it still said "" consolidation '' but they added FFELP on my account summary. Clearly they are giving misinformation to customers and not providing them with the information they need to be able to qualify for these programs. If I had been told in XXXX and XXXX that my loans were not eligible, I could have transferred my loans to a Direct Loan consolidation and then started working towards the 10 year requirement to qualify for the PSLF program. Only finding out now is not only really upsetting because I worked those 10 years towards nothing, but if I switch my loans at this point to Direct Loan consolidation and have to start the clock again, I will pretty much have paid off my loans in 10 years and would not even need the forgiveness program. I urge you to do something about these unethical practices and the misinformation or lack of information student loan services provide their customers on these programs. Clearly it is not in their best interest to have our loans forgiven and I feel that dictates their practices. Given that the DOE has only forgiven 1 % of loans through the PSLF program and there had to be a congressional hearings in XXXX to investigate the practices of the DOE in regards to this forgiveness program, there is clearly some kind of wrongdoing or unethical practices taking place by the DOE and lenders like Navient to prevent people from qualifying for it, whether directly or indirectly through misinformation or lack of information.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,90019,None,Consent provided,Web,03/22/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4234445

The laws referenced are available to the general public. I am aware that my rights were violated and are continuing to be violated in bad faith. 

NAVIENT is engaging in deceptive and abusive debt collection practices from the inception of the alleged business relationship, violating my consumer right to privacy, and undermining my confidence in the banking system. 

Since the consummation of the credit sale occurred after XX/XX/1977, NAVIENT is subject to consumers ' claims and defenses pursuant to 16 CFR 433.3. 

As defined in 16 CFR 433.1, NAVIENT is a seller subject to consumers ' claims and defenses. When the original credit sale was consummated, I, the consumer, was unaware of the seller 's business arrangement with the creditor, nor given disclosure about the determination of the finance charge along with my right of rescission. Upon review of the master promissory note, I have reason to believe and do so believe that my obligation was settled, leaving me with controlling security interest. 

I am aware that I am entitled to twice the finance charge for the violation of 15 U.S. Code 1635 due to my right of rescission never being simply and clearly disclosed to me. 

I have reason to believe and do so believe that NAVIENT is a debt collector engaged in communication in violation of multiple cease and desist notices from me, and is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( a ) ( 1 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( a ) ( 3 ). 

As the consumer, I am aware of the definition in 15 U.S. Code 1692a ( 6 ) that "" the term 'debt collector ' means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts. '' NAVIENT has never received my express consent to communicate with me for the purpose of debt collection, thereby violating 15 U.S. Code 1692c, generally. 

In light of indirect communication through the consumer reporting agencies after the character, amount, and legal status was in dispute via formal notices of dispute, I am invoking my specified remedy pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( c ). 

NAVIENT has violated my cease and desist orders and communicated with relatives without their consent on multiple occasions. NAVIENT has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 7 ) by making the false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer. 

NAVIENT has furnished deceptive forms to instill in the consumer the belief in the consumer that a debt is owed, in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1692j. I consider every word that NAVIENT has uttered in connection with debt collection to be obscene and profane language in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1692d ( 2 ).",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,33647,None,Consent provided,Web,10/05/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4780992

07/21/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Facts of the Matter XXXX, by Federal law is a consumer reporting agency and debt collector, Attempting to collect an alleged debt indirectly as a third party entity for an agreement in which their corporation has made with the RBS CITIZENS NA,. 
The FDCPA and TILA does not specify OR define the term borrower or loan therefore this notion of debt can not be validated in truth even In the highest federal court. 
A loan can not be formed in truth and validity from a CONSUMER CREDIT TRANSACTION. 

Understand, When an organization initiates a loan in a persons commercial name using their open ended consumer credit plan, then creates and furnishes a deceptive form to make a loan appear valid, this is in fact Identity Fraud. That organization shall pay interest to the Consumer for his or her extension of open ended consumer credit within the Corporation of the United States.

RBS CITIZENS NA, is not a federal, but a commercial bank, so by federal law jurisdiction RBS CITIZEN 'S NA, is a debt collector. Because RBS CITIZEN 'S NA, is a non living non breathing entity, they have misused my extension of living open ended consumer credit ( SSN ) and signature to create a fraudulent loan to which they have become the borrower and debtor to the Federal Reserve Bank. They have falsified documents to state that they are the "" original creditor ', but have no extension of living credit to offer living consumers. 

It is impossible to pay on a Positively reflected balanced debt or charge. Therefore, XXXX, and RBS CITIZENS NA, are misleading the consumer, when in fact the Alleged debt balance shows it has already been accounted for. Why is this number not in a negative balance?

15 U.S. Code 1692a - Definitions ( 4 ) The term creditor means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed, but such term does not include any person to the extent that he receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another. 

A Bank, non living entity, can not Lend funds or Extend credit, Therefore a bank can not be an original creditor of any natural person 's consumer credit transaction. The Documentation you have presented constitutes, Identity theft and fraud. Congress however states under 12 USC 1431 that Federal Banks may Borrow and give security therefor and to pay interest thereon, to issue debentures, bonds, or other obligations upon such terms and conditions as the Director may approve, and to do all things necessary for carrying out the provisions of this chapter and all things incident thereto. This notion does not include commercial banks, such as RBS CITIZENS NA.

I, The natural Living man, The original creditor have extended my open ended consumer credit to RBS CITIZENS NA to have it extended back to the Consumer, Myself, using an open ended consumer credit plan Under the Corporation of the United States of America, securely bonded in Surety and trust within my Certificate of Live Birth. 
I was then mislead into a fraudulent contract named a loan when in fact an extension of consumer credit transaction had taken place.

Congress does not define the term Borrower or Loan. Again, however, Congress states Federal Banks may Borrow, this doesn't include commercial banks.

I know who I am, and I Am Invoking my specified remedy as an original creditor and consumer in this consumer credit transaction.

09/29/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have been working with FedLoans ( PHEAA ) to get several monthly payments counted as qualifying payments towards PSLF for several years. 

Issue 1 : In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly payment due was $ XXXX/month. During XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX to FedLoans, and I was placed in an administrative forbearance without my consent. Despite being in an administrative forbearance, I continued to pay my monthly {$0.00} per month even though no bill was generated. Therefore, I have been trying to get those two months counted as qualifying payments towards PSLF for over seven years. 

I have contacted FedLoans about this issue with no resolution. I then contacted the FedLoans Ombudsman after hearing nothing. I still have heard nothing. 

Issue 2 : In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested that my then-current loan servicer, XXXX XXXX, apply a loan interest reduction under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ) since I was serving on XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In that letter, I specifically stated that I did not want to enter into a military forbearance. However, XXXX XXXX placed me into a military forbearance against my wishes. This caused my loans to be in a military forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. ( More info below ). 

In XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were transferred to XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I worked with XXXX XXXX to correct its mistake. XXXX XXXX requested that the Military Forbearance be removed from my account and that the $ XXXX/month ICR payments be counted toward PSLF. 

Finally, in XX/XX/XXXX, FedLoans removed the military forbearance for the period of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, my qualifying payments were recalculated to include XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX to count toward PSLF. However, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX were not counted as qualifying payments even though those were still {$0.00} ICR payments. I made several inquiries about why those three months were not counted, and I have never received an update. 

I have contacted FedLoans about this issue with no resolution. I supplied copies of the paper work from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX in that complaint. I then contacted the FedLoans Ombudsman after hearing nothing.

I was assured over the phone that all I needed to do was continue making payments as I had been, and that there was nothing else I needed to do at that time.

I already know that. The issue is that I was told they would be eligible by an employee of that servicer. 
Please let me know there is another course of action. It is just wrong that they gave me wrong information, but there is no consequence to them, however I am stuck paying for an extra 3 years. 
I believe everyone who was making payments in good faith should get credit for those months towards the 120 needed for PSLF, even if they had the wrong servicer.

When I initially inquired further about this process, I was told that it was available as an option to me given that it's the only solution that is affordable for me, and keeps my Sallie Mae monthly payments consistent and in good status. 

With that, I chose to put forbearances on my account ( which ended up being another issue they had to fix after I filed a CFPB complaint this summer because they kept telling me I was "" approved '' but it wasn't being properly reflected in my account ). 

Now, I am back trying to figure out how to make my monthly payments affordable and the only options offered to me have been interest only payments that very slightly reduce my bill ( from {$520.00} to {$480.00} ) AND keep me in a delinquent status or pay the full monthly fee for three months to show good faith and go from there. 

Neither of these options make sense of me, my credit score, my financials, and Sallie Mae 's ability to get paid. These are not solutions, they are only mere alternatives to keep my interest rates high while Sallie Mae gets a payout. 

I need to get my interest rate and/or monthly payments reduced to be more aligned with what I was paying on their "" Rate Reduction Program ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account manager and the various reps that I've spoken to have told me that they see that I SHOULD still qualify but for some reason the system is listing me as ineligible. My account manager XXXX XXXX informed me that he had no idea why and there isn't a way for him to see the reason for that. He mentioned that Sallie Mae has undergone significant changes this year so that could be the reason why -- but this is still super unacceptable to me. 

The max monthly payment that I can currently afford is $ XXXX/month. I need actual solutions from Sallie Mae and less of this unclear back and forth that makes me feel as though they are XXXX  with my account in an attempt to keep their business as profitable as it can be. 

This coupled with the miscommunication delivered in regard to my continuous need to apply for a forbearance on my account, has put me in a position where I feel like this company either is failing to implement new protocols and communicate them to consumers OR this is all a part of their plan to increase profits during the hardship that has been the Covid-19 pandemic.

They are a behemoth whove been enabled by the current economic and higher educational climate to intimidate and bully us well-meaning and patriotic Americans!!! 

Their threatening phone calls occur during all hours of the day starting at XXXX XXXX  and continuing unrelenting until XXXX XXXX  daily. AND even on Sundays! 

My sons XXXX and XXXX, as well as myself XXXX XXXX XXXX, are all cosigners for my granddaughter XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX pandemic, as well as her hospitalization for health issues, as well as unemployment stemming from the challenging economic climate, led to her difficulty and delinquency trying to meet her student loan obligations. She is now working two jobs to help pay down her debt.

I am a senior citizen on a limited income from a career as a civil servant trying when I can to help her financially on occasion. This Sallie Mae is a coldblooded institution. Theyre trying to get blood from a stone from a responsible and conscientious young adult who is paying monthly and not seeing any results.

As far as the consequences are concerned from my perspective, at the start of XX/XX/2020I had a credit score of XXXX. It is now in the XXXX range, as is also the case of my sons XXXX and XXXX, whom also had exceptional credit scores.

Why cant they combine the loans, make it one payment so we can see where the money is going? Interests and fees!?!? Are you kidding me? None of us know where the money goes to or which account. They do not make it easy to understand their billing statements!!! I feel they are robbing these kids blind and they will never get ahead for years to come.
And us hard-working Americans who support our children are offered up as collateral damage so these corporate monoliths pad their fat wallers and leave our kids indebted to these thieves for life!

Hopefully Sen. XXXX XXXX can help with this problem, along with Congressman XXXX. I am imploring your help and expertise to really delve into the hidden numbers game, obnoxious and intrusive communication tactics, and predatory lending practices which exploit our youth who seek higher education to better themselves and society as a whole.

( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b.

I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ).

10/10/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have made a total of 89 regular payments to my FedLoans, each of which the FedLoan agents told me would count towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan for teachers. I have been a public school educator since the beginning of my career in XXXX and I communicated directly and intentionally with the FedLoan agents that I needed to be on the PSLF program from the outset, only to later find out that I was lied to and misguided by FedLoan and their agents. In addition, since the COVID-19 pandemic ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), 21 additional payments have been applied to PSLF. Therefore under TEPSLF, 110 payments should be tracking for expected forgiveness.

FedLoan is only counting 61 payments for forgiveness under TEPSLF because they will not count any payments I made between XXXX because they say a. ) I was on the wrong plan ( a plan they put me on knowing I was/am a public educator ) and b. ) I consolidated my loans ( the consolidation occurred because they pressured me to do so with daily calls in which they said if I wanted all of my payments to count towards PSLF then I must consolidate ) Dishonest guidance and aggressive, predatory tactics from FedLoan agents have ruined my ability to stabilize my life and build a foundation with which to support my family, and I am still a public educator with an enormous amount of debt.

I have always been a public school educator and fully anticipated and communicated to the FedLoan agents from the outset and on several occasions that this was the case. FedLoan agents assured me that I was on the right plan and never told me that I was on the wrong plan. From the outset, I paid large amounts ( in the beginning I paid approximately {$450.00}, then {$850.00}, and now {$1300.00} per month ) toward my student loan debt and believed that every single one of my payments counted towards loan forgiveness. As late as XXXX, with three full years of loan payments completed, FedLoan agents directed me to consolidate loans that did not need to be consolidated and did not direct me to consolidate loans that required consolidation to be eligible for PSLF throughout the beginning years of loan repayment. 

In addition, in XXXX, I received daily calls from FedLoan agents, pressuring me to consolidate all of my loans. I was confused and said that I just wanted to stay on my current PSLF plan ( that I had been erroneously told by FedLoan agents that I was on ). Every single time we discussed PSLF I explained that I needed each payment to count towards forgiveness. I was assured repeatedly that consolidation would not harm my current PSLF pathway and that all of my previous and future payments would continue to count for PSLF. The FedLoan agents never told me that my payments from XXXX were not counting for PSLF forgiveness on the pathway that they had directed me to take. The FedLoan agents instead stated that all payments before and after loan consolidation would continue to count.

The interest rate and compound interest are so high on these loans that I have literally paid {$110000.00} which is approximately {$50000.00} more than I initially borrowed and I still owe {$50000.00} to complete the loan payments.

By remaining with FedLoan and believing all of my payments were qualifying for PLSF due to the directives, misinformation, and lies provided by the FedLoan agents and their ongoing reassurance that the payments were counting, I have been unnecessarily harmed in the following ways : 1. For five years, XXXX, I made 34 full loan payments that are not being counted towards PSLF forgiveness, even though I followed the directives from FedLoan agents.

I have paid a large amount of interest and continue to do so, rather than switching to a less expensive loan with a reasonable interest rate because I believed I was on a qualifying PSLF plan, as directed and issued by PSLF loan agents, and I believed the loans would be forgiven after the 10 years of payments.

2. I have been unable to stabilize my own life due to misinformation from FedLoan agents, excessive interest, and extended payments on these loans- thus blocking my ability to buy a house, pay for my children 's college, contribute to retirement, etc.

3. These loans have literally ruined my life and I wish I had never taken them. Currently, I have approximately {$50000.00} left to pay ; I've already paid {$110000.00}, and I initially got a loan for around {$70000.00} for the entirety of my degree. I have paid more than my share, I have worked for more than 10 years as a public educator, and I am furious at FedLoan for misguiding me throughout this whole process and thereby disrupting and severely limiting my quality of life.

09/22/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"This complaint is due to predatory fees charged to me by AES, the loan servicer over the last several years, dating back to XXXX. At that time, there was a change made by the company/servicer ( not myself ) in how auto payments are made/withdrawn. I have been on auto payments since that time and afterward, with a payment withdrawn monthly, never late as far as I knew. I had never logged into their new website, or created a login, as I had no reason to, having been on auto payments and on time for years. In late XXXX, I randomly decided to check up on my loan and how much is left. After creating an account and logging in, I come to find out that since this auto payment method change several years ago, a payment date was somehow offset at the time, with them charging me a small fee. No problem. That is until I dug deeper, and saw a constant identical fee, beginning from that date, being charged to me monthly, over and over, for the last several years until XXXX without my knowledge. Without any communication to me by phone, email or letter that I ever received. This "" computerized error '' or offset, caused them to continue to assess me a late fee every month for several years, totaling over {$1000.00}. Despite the fact I was on auto pay and payments were deducted without issue from my account over the entire period. 

Realizing what was happening, I attempted to contact AES both through their website and by phone, but without any proper response or resolution. I would receive a canned response stating the payment back in XXXX was late, which caused a chain effect of every payment being late by a set amount of days ( despite being on auto pay with them for several years ), that they were in the right to charge me these fees. This is without my knowledge, consent, or due diligence made to contact me about the issue. While it may not be intentional and automated on their part, it is predatory in every sense, and I am well within my rights to file suit against them for the fees. 

Instead, I chose to give them multiple opportunities to rectify the problem. Because I could not get anything but a canned response from them, or speak to anyone higher up, I was forced to purposefully stop payment on my loan until the issue was resolved. This worked, as after 2 months, I was finally able to get them to contact me, at which point I finally spoke to someone who could escalate this through the company. I finally spoke to a gentleman who was helpful ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), took all of my info and complaint, and said it would go to the right place to try and get a resolution. They even agreed with me that the situation was unfortunate, and if they had been in my shoes, they would be equally upset and seek a resolution. Unfortunately, after being sent to their "" decision makers '' the response was the same. That they were within their right to take advantage of me and charge these fees going back to XX/XX/XXXX. They cited the website ( which I never logged into, nor was I obligated to ) as a way I could have checked sooner. They cited an old email account they had on file I no longer use that had auto emails sent there. Needless to say, if I was aware of some small {$6.00} monthly charge accruing on my auto pay account, due to some automated adjustment that offset my auto payment into a date that forced them to be late, I would have taken care of it in XXXX. 

Because AES was not being cooperative and it became clear they had no interest in actually doing the right thing for a customer that was taken advantage of by them, I chose to terminate my loan with them by paying it off in full immediately, removing any additional interest they could potentially make. This brought my account completely current, including the predatory fees they charged, and paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX. This was after months of trying to work with them to resolve the situation. And despite being upset about the situation, I had more important things in my life, and chose to let it go, knowing full well my situation was not unique and they have likely pulled this stunt on tens of thousands of other borrowers. 

Not being content with the fees being paid, and the loan paid in full, AES also placed a negative mark on my credit report for being 90 days past due in XXXX. This was despite the fact I let them know in advance I was stopping payment to force a call back from them and get a resolution. My communication stated that the moment someone contacts me, and they begin the resolution process, whether successful or not, I would pay all that is owed. And I did just that. Had I not done so, I would have never even been able to reach the manager that I did, to try and properly resolve the situation. Until I stopped payment, I couldn't get any meaningful assistance through AES. 

So not only has AES taken advantage of myself, a borrower that was on auto pay, and paid on time during these several years, ripping me off with predatory fees. Not only could I not get proper response from them until I stopped making payments. But then after following proper channels and giving them every opportunity, followed by paying my loan IN FULL, they turned around and nailed my credit, taking it from a perfect XXXX score to the XXXX. 

So this situation will no longer stand and I am filing this complaint. It is my final, good faith effort to get someone at AES to act like a human being, realize what happened was predatory, and resolve the situation. Meaning return the illegitimate fees and remove the mark on my credit. If it is not done, I have all the paper trail, all the dates, and all the details necessary ( many provided and attached here ) to take this to a class action lawyer and let them seek justice for not just myself, but who knows how many others taken advantage of in this same manner. 

I am willing to let this be published in the CFPB checked below, in the hopes that many others will see this, some who have also been taken advantage of in the same way. And if enough come forward, grounds to seek justice for the predatory behavior by AES and the lender XXXX  XXXX, that once presented with the evidence, chose to not refund the predatory fees billed to me in small increments, without my knowledge, while on auto pay, going back to XXXX.",None,AES/PHEAA,CA,92880,None,Consent provided,Web,09/22/21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4744055

I am currently a federal employee that is participating in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I have been submitting my yearly certification forms and my last certification form has employment approved through XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XXXX, I received my certification report. First, the form lists more PSLF Eligible Payments than Qualifying Payments ( 89 to 84 for some loans and 79 to 74 for other loans ). However, the letter does not explain why certain eligible payments are not counted as qualifying payments.

Additionally, assuming that the Qualifying Payments are actually correct, the estimated eligibility dates for these sets of loans are as follows : XX/XX/XXXX for loans with 36 payments remaining and XX/XX/XXXX for loans with 46 payments remaining. However, given that this last certification was approved on XX/XX/XXXX, these dates are incorrect. For the loans with 36 payments remaining, the estimated date should be XX/XX/XXXX ; for the remaining loans it should be XX/XX/XXXX. These were the dates that appeared on previous forms ; however, since actions were taken by the government to pause student loans during COVID-19, these dates have changed and are now inaccurate. I have spoken with FedLoan about this and have received assurance that it would be corrected ; however, this is the second certification form I have submitted where this has not been fixed.

I am requesting that FedLoan review my file and update my payment information with accurate information. It appears that there are various inaccuracies even though my employment has not changed during my entire time in the PSLF program.

10/08/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I began to pull out loans during my time at XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX between XXXX. I tried to get my career started and began working in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX utilizing my XXXX XXXX. I returned to get my XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Between XXXX and XXXX I contacted my loan servicer at the time which was XXXX XXXX then XXXX. When I mentioned it would be hard for me to make payments and try to make a living the forbearance options was always presented and companies never seemed willing to educate me on my options. I was able to extend my loans during my time completing my XXXX XXXX. When I completed that I was relocating cities, trying to get married and buy a house. Again I was not offered useful advice other than high payments or going back on forbearance. After educating myself on Public service loan forgiveness, and having to consolidate in order for them to qualify I have been actively making payments since XXXX of XXXX. 
My loans then were transferred to Fed Loans. This has been a horrible experience. Doing paper work for the loans is once a year but it is a time I sincerely dread. This is because the 2-3 week period of contact, calls, emails etc and follow up to feel secure that I'm getting correct service. If you look up my recorded calls you can get an idea of the poor service and negligence at that company. Every time it has been a struggle getting my documents in in. I constantly have to call and remind them to check their fax. There would be times weeks and months go by and I call and all of a sudden the fax I sent is there after I ask they go look for it. Where I got very worried is when my wife was not working because she was doing student teaching hours. I knew I was going to dread this because it was another time I had to contact fed loans aside from my yearly verification. I had let fed loans know our income would be drastically decreasing. After being assured the amount would be adjusted correctly the first payment I received had double to over XXXX dollars if I remember correctly from previously being around XXXX. I called again and asked what happened and the response I received is "" it was a mistake and the wrong information was used ''. What is that suppose to mean? How is that suppose to make me feel moving forward trying to complete 10 years of payments? How do I know my information has been correct every year? Are people income and financial information being used incorrectly or inputted wrong? I do not see what happens on the other side of that call and every year some new large payment is given to me and I have to try and negotiate a lower amount. If this is suppose to be set why are they always negotiating different amounts and "" checking things '' I was extremely upset about this and have not felt secure about my loans ever since. Every year I feel like there is a mistake and I can not do anything about it. Honestly I don't feel confident making payments until XXXX feeling that other financial information is being used that is effecting my life. 
Something else that I have discussed with agents is not having credit for being a homeowner or holding a steady job or career. We are pushed so much to go to college and trying to be successful and be a home owner. When I explained that my mortgage is XXXX and if that get considered they said no. Why are payment calculated off of gross income? I always ask this because we are given payment plans for money we do not. I have to report a certain amount of money that I only maybe get half of? For example I make XXXX, my mortgage is XXXX and you want XXXX from me? How I'm I suppose to enjoy my life, career, family etc? I was in college during California 's budget crisis when cost of tuition skyrocketed, teachers were being let go and we were having adjunct professors and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. That is not what I paid for. Our education system tells us to go to college and be successful and we are promised a certain amount of money for having a degree. My first job after college with my degree had me making XXXX dollars an hour! How I'm I going to have any success with XXXX a year? I returned to get my masters to make more money but of course It cost me so much more in loans. When you are young and struggling to eat and pay rent putting off payments sounds like a great option. But people who have those jobs are probably coached to offer forbearance rather than the proper advice to help you improve your situation. 
This may not meet the requirements of this complaint system but I do not know where else to voice these concerns. I have been working in public service since XXXX and it is now XXXX and was never offered the public service loan forgiveness.

10/06/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Over the past few years, through requested audits and working with the CFPB and the North Carolina Department of Justice, Consumer Protection unit, I have tried to receive a fair evaluation of payments I've made to the PSLF program.

However, despite that, there are six ( 6 ) payments that still aren't counted as part of my overall PSLF eligible payments made that I believe should be considered eligible due to my conversations with Fed Loan Servicing phone representatives, who advised me each time I had questions about my account. These phone representatives took notes during each of our calls, and it is my belief that Fed Loan Servicing should look into those notes, which will verify that the following payments should be counted as part of my PSLF counts : 1. XX/XX/XXXX 2. XX/XX/XXXX 3. XX/XX/XXXX 4. XX/XX/XXXX ( You've stated that you will be making a correction to have this payment count ) 5. XX/XX/XXXX 6. XX/XX/XXXX With Fed Loan Servicing sending student loan accounts to a new servicer this XXXX, I believe that this issue needs to be resolved prior to the transfer of my account. 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 


-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Email on XX/XX/XXXX Dear Fed Loan Serving, I wanted to provide my addendum regarding my request for an audit of my account prior to any transfer to my account to a new student loan servicer. Specifically, I would like a detailed explanation as to why the following student loan payments were *not* counted as part of PSLF counts, which is currently at XXXX/XXXX. It is my belief that based on guidance from Fed loan Servicing phone representatives, I followed the appropriate instructions related to payments for the following months and believe that they should part of my PSLF counts : 1. XX/XX/XXXX 2. XX/XX/XXXX 3. XX/XX/XXXX 4. XX/XX/XXXX ( You've stated that you will be making a correction to have this payment count ) 5. XX/XX/XXXX 6. XX/XX/XXXX Throughout my experience with Fed Loan servicing, I have always turned to your phone representatives to answer any questions I had related to my payments, and believe that the 6 monthly payments should count toward my PSLF. 

Because of the urgency of this issue and the transfer of Fed Loan student loan accounts to another servicer in the next few months, I will be elevating this issue to the CFPB and the North Carolina Department of Justice, Consumer Protection Unit. 

Please conduct a diligent audit for the months noted above, so that this issue can be fully resolved before the transfer of my account to a new servicer. 

Thank you, and I appreciate all of your help in this matter.

10/05/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"On approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I refinanced my student loans. My loans were previously serviced by UAS ( https : //www.uasconnect.com/ ). 

The new lender made a larger payment than the balance on my loans to UAS. Therefore, UAS is supposed to refund the overpayment back to the new lender. 

However, they did not make any such payment and quietly updated the balance on my account from a negative number ( reflecting the overpayment ) to zero ( suggesting that they did not owe me/ the new lender anything ). 

I called UAS and they claim to have sent out the funds. I called the new lender and they said that they have not received anything. I called back UAS and they said that they have to do "" research '' for an extended period of time. 

After that extended period of time ( 15 days to 1 month, can't remember exactly as I had marked it on my calendar ), I called up UAS. UAS claims once again that they sent the check ( again ) on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I spoke with the new lender again. Once again, the new lender has not received the check. 

The new lender is being very cooperative and transparent but UAS is not providing any information. UAS is unable to provide any proof of sending the check. They are not able to provide the mailing address to which they sent the check. They are not able to provide the check number. They do not have any tracking number either. They keep changing the information when called. They now claim that it takes 30 days for the check to go via USPS. I've never heard of anything taking 30 days via USPS and I am increasingly suspicious that they haven't actually sent the check and are simply trying to pocket the money and hoping that I will forget. 

In summary, I am losing money over UAS failing to send the refund check. It has been more than 6 months since I have refinanced my loans. I am not sure what the next best steps are. If this path ( a complaint to CFPB ) is unable to result in a successful resolution, then I'm thinking I file a claim in small claims court.",None,TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC,MA,02215,None,Consent provided,Web,10/05/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4780212

Today the invoice is due and the director of compliance stated at this time they are unable to pay invoices submitted by consumerd. This is an issue because there is no law that says they are allowed to ignore a remedy or payments required from them because they violated a consumer. There is no law that states the debt collectors inability to pay an invoice is acceptable and should be accepted as a response by the consumer. Their networth is over a million so theres no reason they can not pay an invoice that wouldnt have been created if they followed the law in the first place. I can issue another invoice for this matter including the violations from the first invoice along with the violations concerning the payment of this second invoice but, I wont need to if they follow this first invoice. Also, I asked before in the previous complaint against them that if there were any issues with the invoice, they need to contact me before the due date. They did not follow that complaint or aspect of my remedy so I have the opportunity to send another invoice concerning that violation as well.

In preparation for the latest round of requests for that, I went onto StudentAid.Gov and found a number of discrepancies that I would like your help with understanding and hopefully correcting. 

My student loan ( actual student loans with no consolidation ) story began in XXXX and continued through XXXX while I was in undergrad, graduate school and a year at law school, where I learned that was not the career for me. This loan history, along with helpful notations like paid in full, cancelled, and paid in full by consolidation '' ( as distinct from paid in full ) are noted. I have attached a sheet and while the notes regarding what was paid in full by me privately versus what was paid in full by consolidation match what I actually recall, the subsequent activity and notes in the details about loans that were paid in full getting paid a second time by consolidation are alarming and may explain how I now owe {$140000.00} after borrowing {$94000.00}, of which {$18000.00} was cancelled due to fraud and toward the retirement of which {$23000.00} in payments were made to various servicers retained by the Department of Education. 

By their own records, between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( while I was in school ) I consolidated {$20000.00} in subsidized loans and {$28000.00} in unsubsidized loans. I think those are most likely wrong because in XXXX including loans that I took out in XXXX to XXXX I had {$36000.00} in subsidized loans and {$21000.00} in unsubsidized loans and had made payments to the providers. Nevertheless, in XXXX the Department of Education consolidated in Direct Loans ( with in school payment and interest forbearance and a promise of cancellation after 25 years ) {$49000.00} in student loans which we can say was my outstanding balance as of XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I had secured a fellowship but the funding was pulled so I subsequently went back and took out {$13000.00} in subsidized loans and {$4900.00} in unsubsidized loans. Those were backed by the XXXX and I paid those loans back directly to them through a compromise with a payments of 75 % of the balance. 

In XXXX, 7 years after my first consolidation, my loans were reconsolidated and switched to a new servicer, the amounts reconsolidated for the non-subsidized portion were {$7300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$37000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The subsidized loans followed that pattern with {$19000.00} consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX and {$26000.00} consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX. Then, in XXXX, another new servicer and another consolidation with the balances growing to {$62000.00} and {$79000.00} under the new servicer. 

So, just to recap, {$94000.00} dollars in loans, {$18000.00} of which were cancelled, so a net of {$76000.00} in actual loans with payments of {$23000.00} to the various servicers of the consolidated loans and {$18000.00} paid back directly to the guarantor and somehow I owe more than {$140000.00} and I would like to request documentation of that.

10/05/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"Summary of complaint : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( lender ) has demonstrated opaque, unfair, and unethical policies towards international student loan borrowers by denying them the right to seek refinancing of their loans and refusing the release of co-borrowers. 

Description : 1 ) I have an international student loan under repayment from the lender ( taken in 2011 ). Even though I am not in the US, I have been making regular payments towards the loan and have never defaulted. 

2 ) Over the past 2 years, though there has been a significant reduction in the student loan interest rates, the lender is still charging me 5.5 % APR. In spite of making multiple requests to the lender to refinance my loan at the reduced interest rates, I am being denied the right to do so. 

3 ) The lender claims that they can not refinance international student loans where borrowers do not meet the requirements of a current US address. However, they seemed it perfectly ok to grant me the original loan in 2011 even though I did not have a US address at that time. This opaqueness of policy and loan terms is grossly unfair and unethical towards international student loan borrowers. 

4 ) As a result of the lender 's refusal to refinance my loan, I am having to bear an additional interest burden of over {$30000.00}. In my view, this practice of denying refinancing to international student loan borrowers is extremely unfair and in gross violation of consumer protection rights. 

5 ) As an international student loan borrower, the lender has also refused my request for the release of my co-borrower without giving any proper reason or justification. 

6 ) Over the past 2 years, I have made multiple phone calls and written multiple times to the lender escalating the above issues and request resolution. However, they have flatly refused to honor my request, citing opaque policy reasons. 

7 ) The lender has also cited that provisions and terms mentioned in the loan promissory note prohibit them from refinancing the loan to international borrowers. However, this is blatantly false as there are no such terms mentioned in the promissory note. 

8 ) I thus wish to bring the above unfair and unethical practices of the lender to the attention of CFPB for redressal and resolution.",None,TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC,None,None,None,Consent provided,Web,10/05/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4780211

09/26/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Hi, I am currently trying to become eligible for the public service loan forgiveness program. As you are aware, in order to qualify, you must make 120 timely payments on the loans to be eligible for forgiveness. Over the past 8-9 years, I have been making timely monthly loan payments under the IBR program . I make a single lump-sum payment, and the servicer applies the payment to the nine different loans that constitute my universe of law school student loans.

For eight of my nine loans, I am right on track for forgiveness -- - I only have a year and a half to two years left of payments to make left. For one of the loans, the servicer said something like five full years of payments were untimely. The servicer agrees that I made them, but has deemed them untimely. However, as stated, during those five years, I made a single payment to the servicer, and they attributed the payments made to the individual loans. So, even when I made a timely payment ( and they correctly attributed the timely payments to eight of my nine loans ), the servicer delayed the attribution of a portion of my payment to one of my loans, such that the payment ( in their internal system ) is late. But that "" lateness '' is due to their actions, not mine.

Accordingly, for one of my nine loans, they state that I will not be eligible for forgiveness until XXXX or XXXX ( my other loans will be eligible for forgiveness in XXXX or XXXX ). I raised the issue with my servicer, and after considering it for 8 months, they rejected my request.",None,AES/PHEAA,MD,20910,None,Consent provided,Web,10/06/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4754822

03/23/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"During the month of XX/XX/XXXX, 2 months before my new repayment period was scheduled to begin, I submitted an economic hardship application per then Sallie Maes instructions, only to receive a letter back, weeks later, informing me that I applied too early. The representative I spoke with prior, never mentioned a time frame in which my submittal had to adhere to. This incomplete response to my inquiry was the beginning of what would turn out to be a very cumbersome, contradictory and fraught process. 

I then filed out subsequent documentation that was sent to me and submitted accordingly. For the next few months, I received nothing but inconsistent and inadequate information as the process stumbled along, eventually leading to a letter from NYSHESC, sometime during the spring. It advised me that my account was in jeopardy of default. It was in this letter where I first learned of an option that was income related. Although I applied for the IBR plan in XXXX, I kept receiving conflicting correspondence from XXXX. I actually received one letter instructing me to apply for a deferment, while another thanked me for inquiring about the IBR, both with the same date. There was one instance where I was sent a pre-populated IRS form, which I needed to sign and sent back so my tax return could be obtain directly from IRS, only to later received a follow-up letter from XXXX stating that these document can not be retrieved from IRS. No reason was given as to why this was so. I was then instructed to submit my tax return directly to XXXX. Even though I had already submitted my tax return back in XXXX. By this time I had completed my next year tax return which was indeed different from the previous year one submitted in XXXX, so I went ahead and submitted the newly completed tax return as well. Around this time, I began receiving delinquent notifications from XXXX threatenng to report me to the credit agencies ( it wasnt just a threat ) and instructing me to get in touch with them, even though I was already in touch with them through this process. It wasnt until NYHESC got involved for a second time in the fall that the process moved forward. Unbeknownst to me, during this time my account was racking up quarterly/monthly capitalized interest including {$5900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was finally place in an IBR, in XX/XX/XXXX, over a year from my initial economic hardship application. 

There is a capitalized interest in the amount of {$5900.00}, added to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. What I want to know is, 1 ) If the amount I paid on XX/XX/XXXX was sufficient to cover all monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX, why was my account charged {$5900.00} capitalized interest on XX/XX/XXXX in this amount? 2 ) How did that much interest accrued during this paid-ahead period? History of the account shows prior capitalized interest were added to my account only at the end of a forbearance period in which I wasnt paying anything, but never at the end of a period in which there were payments made, especially paid-ahead payments. 3 ) And why throughout the rest of the year I kept racking up additional capitalized interest with that much interest already capitalized in XXXX? I do understand that interest can be capitalized yearly OR quarterly, but I was unaware of interest being capitalized both yearly AND quarterly and in one instance 2 months in a row. All negative impact that occurred on my account for this year had nothing to do with my lack of responsibility or efforts, but rather everything to do with your corporations inconsistent, inadequate, insufficient instructions.

10/06/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Nelnet is reporting to the credit reporting agencies that accounts ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) have late payments. However, they are all associated with proven student loan repayment fraud against me during XXXX and XXXX. I was not late, I was being frauded. This student loan fraud case was prosecuted with the United States Attorneys Office, XXXX California District Number : Case Number XXXX. Again, I was not late, I was being frauded by XXXX which was a fraudulent student loan debt relief scheme found guilty of defrauding me in the court of law. Docket Number:XXXXXXXX. 
Nelnet acknowledged In CFPB complaint number XXXX ( see attached ), that "" There are companies looking to profit from student loan borrowers who are unaware their loan servicer can assist with loan management at no cost. Many debt relief or document preparation companies solicit borrowers by offering assistance in applying for repayment, consolidation, or loan forgiveness options in exchange for a fee. We understand the FTC has investigated XXXX, and found fraudulent activity within their organization ''. 
Neltnet in complicit in these violations with a class action lawsuit against Nelnet showing Nelnet violated many federal regulations which exacerbated the problem. 

Most prominent are : - Failure to maintain the borrowers scheduled monthly payment amount and recertify applications timely. 
- Provided unclear information about how to re-enroll in income-driven repayment plans. 
- Failure to process IDR Plan applications timely. 
- Adding interest to principal and thereby increasing the principal owed, driving the interest cost upward contrary to prohibitions against adding interest to the principal balance ( a process called capitalization of interest ). 
- Failure to process applications promptly. 

Ultimately, due to the failures of Nelnet described in the class action lawsuit. I, the borrower, was unaware that Nelnet, the servicer, could assist with loan management at no cost, because Nelnet never provided clear information about how to enroll in income-driven repayment plans, which left me, the borrow, to be preyed upon by fraudulent student debt schemes Furthermore, Nelnet 's reporting data is questionable and needs to be fixed in it's entirety. Nelnet acknowledged In CFPB complaint number XXXX ( see attached ), that they made in errors in reporting my accounts to the credit reporting agencies when they discovered they erroneously furnished data reflecting my loans ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) as 120 days past due in XX/XX/XXXX, in addition to these accounts. Nelnet needs to fix the remaining accounts being reported as late. 

Further proof of Nelnet 's inaccuracies were identified in XXXX of XXXX. During COVID forbearance I found that my Nelnet balance increased despite {$83.00} a month being paid through my jobs loan repayment service. How can this be? How during COVID forbearance, and payments still being received By Nelnet, can my balance increase? On XX/XX/XXXX I called Nelnet about discrepancies in the principle balance between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. It went up from {$71000.00} to {$72000.00}. During this telephone conversation, Nelnet admitted that they made mistake and applied {$36.00} to my principle balance.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",CA,95829,None,Consent provided,Web,10/06/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4785458

03/01/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"I am writing regarding me being cosigned on a private student Sallie Mae loan, but the primary borrower is someone else. The loan adds to XXXX dollars from a XXXX loan with 11 % interest variable and another with a fixed 3.5 % all done without me truly looking at this, until I started calling the company for details because they said I was allowed to review the loan which I thought I could not do. The borrower is XXXX XXXX. The borrower had been living with me for almost a year. 

The college was assisting her with the loans. Supposedly, a big mistake was made here. I never really understood student loans or lending practices. The borrower said she was applying for a loan, presented Sallie Mae as a federal loan. What I have been reading about this company, it says they handle Federal loans. But they keep sending mail to my place and she is no where to be found. 

The borrower was never straight forward with me about this loan but required an address for her to receive mail. Neither was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a for profit making college in the city of New York. The borrower was staying with me in my parents home during the year XXXX, the year my father 's health declined with almost a full year of hospitalization back and forth affecting us during the XXXX Season of that year. I spent most of the time in the hospital and the borrower was home, sometimes by themselves. I felt Sallie Mae was asking to many questions about finances about me for someone else taking a loan. Now, I never applied for this loan or placed a physical signature on any document. My understanding with the borrower was, the address was for her to have the bills sent, not for me to be responsible for the loans because I was not the student. XXXX understood this very clearly. 

With all my personal family issues affected the relationship between borrower and myself. She eventually left to move into a college dorm due to my emotional distress. Supposedly, my address was needed for her to receive statements from Sallie Mae, which led me to believe they were Federal Loans that is all.

From the beginning, I did not personally feel right about the cosigner issue, first I did not understand why a student loan needed a cosigner, if bankruptcy was not applicable to student loans and because my job at the time was in jeopardy, she told me she needed money to cover the cost or else she could not continue college. Meanwhile, I was under the impression that Sallie Mae was a government servicer. I said please go for the government loan without cosigner because I can not respond, please, to resolve this issue. I do not want to be tied to this loan, perhaps decline the money if other parties are subject to payment. 


The borrower themselves, had a multitude of health problems, all related to her XXXX  from a XXXX years ago, and other issues requiring she take iron infusion, she was under a lot of pressure to finish college on the grounds and I quote "" I am eventually going XXXX '' I need to get my XXXX XXXX because she always wanted to be an Art Teacher, between my father and this situation, I am on under an emotional chokehold. She was an older graduate in her 40s came out in a local newspaper back in Alabama, she survived Hurricane Katrina, graduated from XXXX XXXX XXXX, in Alabama, onto an Art School in XXXX XXXX  XXXX, where I worked. 

She graduated with honors, was now living at the dorm during the summer of 2019, and that summer Sallie Mae started sending letters that the actual process of payment begins on XX/XX/2019, I told her what she will do. She was responsive answered emails and calls, said, she is reviewing her options to get me off the loan by either refinancing or consolidation of all her loans because a huge mistake was made here, if she is guilty of it. Her eyes started bothering her, frequent headaches and so on, she did not know whether she can obtain employment, live in XXXX so went back to Alabama for better weather for her eyes. Emails and calls continued. 

I even called Sallie Mae on her behalf they offered a XXXX form and if she can get the doctors to provide the documents, they were willing to review and provide a waiver and I am no longer obligated, as told to me by Sallie Mae, if the borrower dies or becomes permanently XXXX cosigners fall off. Around XXXX and XXXX, the correspondence started to decline. I asked the representatives at Sallie Mae, if they are a government loan, they never responded with a clear answer. 

She kept saying I am working on it, she did not want to originally go on forbearance because of accruing interests, I agreed, but she said that maybe she should and forbearance was first granted from XXXX until XXXX XXXX, when suddenly I needed to be in isolation by the standards of my new job, because I live with vulnerable elderly parents. 

By this time, my father was XXXX confined to a XXXX  and on dialysis. My dad is a veteran. When President Trump suspended payments on student loans with no interest, I said that provides relief, but Sallie Mae sends a bill, I obviously can not respond to this, from where, so she was informed by me, no response, after, she was taking care of it was the last response. 

When I delivered the last official message, she had been at the XXXX  XXXX and she sent me a scan and I did see her name about what was found in both her eyes. So, these emails were cordial and respectful, at least I want to believe, but when we all went into isolation I kept emailing until the emails were no longer deliverable. 

I called Sallie Mae to inquire whether they have heard from her, the answer was no, I have been the one calling, they provided me a phone number for her, but it no longer was functioning number. 

She ran a credit bill without my consent, for medical eye supplies, I tolerated this for a total of XXXX I had to close this. 

She has always said you wont pay for it meaning me so don't worry about this, I will take care of this. I have email correspondences and texts that verify she was working on this to resolve the issue, telling me she was responsible and honorable. 


But she continued to say her school was not covering the cost and along comes Sallie Mae, I thought that was government, mind you too much is already on my mind, my father and my job constantly telling us we may lose our employment, I did not believe until we were all laid off. 

These texts are on my XXXX and some old emails. Finally when contact slipped I called Sallie Mae taking it to the complaints department to even a fraud department, which involved a police report, making the case serious, but I do not know her whereabouts or what happened to her, if something did happen. Its a tough one The relationship I have with the borrower was one which has extended for about 20 years, today does not exist, I don't know what happened to her. The last message was "" this will be taken care of '' If its true that supposedly I am also responsible for payment against my will, then Sallie Mae approved a loan knowing that I had a large Federal Student Loan, plus about to lose a job. Turns out XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted the borrower through mails sent to me. This seems to be another loan that is 159 days past due, I have those letters. I even sent the letter via email but no response. 

The borrower assured me they would handle this by consolidation or refinance, upon them graduating which they did in 2019. Sallie Mae now wanted payments, supposedly the borrower had health issues and may not be able to work. I did send the documents to a church she attended for Sallie Mae before COVID 19, but she was no longer a part of the congregation.

COVID-19 hits a week later and the borrower is nowhere to be found and Sallie Mae does not seem to comprehend this in the beginning, so I have no choice but to put this loan on forbearance, they gave a COVID-19 forbearance, its all I can do because they said I could do this as a cosigner, but I reject this because I never applied for a Sallie Mae Loan with signature. I let them know and they remain silent. Now, i feel the representation of this company is secretive and no longer feel comfortable in communicating with Sallie Mae.

The complaints office of consumer affairs was informed and an option provided here, was if I file with a local civil court this should get her attention, but if I can produce a document with a judge ruling in my favor regarding this, send Sallie Mae the document and they will honor this and remove my name from the loan. Again, I need a written statement, i receive the run around and no response or email only when they want to collect money. Also, if the loan has no borrower to be found and I dont have the option for release then its void, as I was told by the complaints department, why pay this if I can not. I just told them I'm up against the wall, I can not pay, so they have been warned by me for a whole year. Whether they care or not, I must watch out for myself now that the borrower is no where to be found.

Obviously, I reached out to borrower and no signal or even concern, so its a mystery. I can not judge where she is at or what happened. Its the end of the year, no concern about the civil issues, bankruptcy, or the 159 days behind with XXXX simply no response. 

I am supposedly cosigned according to Sallie Mae, not according to me and i can not take this extra debt upon me, it will only be fair to allow me to at least declare bankruptcy. After all no loan forgiveness is offered or other programs for these kinds of loans now that I did my research.

I just have elderly folks, one a veteran father who is XXXX and they are more important than a private student loan company from almost a nonexistent borrower is how I feel, I must be upfront here. Because this time I must put my parents first, its a moral justification, which I don't expect a bank to understand but its my family, I understand. I do not have children nor am I married.

07/24/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am currently participating in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( "" PSLF '' ) Program, a federal program managed by the Department of Education and any applicable student loan servicers, which allows for student loan balances to be forgiven for individuals who work for qualifying non-profit or governmental employers and make qualifying payments for a certain amount of time ( 10 years total ), subject to other terms and conditions. As part of this program, I submit what is called an Employer Certification Form ( "" ECF '' ) annually to my student loan servicer FedLoan Servicing ( "" FedLoan '' ), which certifies that my non-profit employer is a qualifying employer for the program. I have received approval of my ECF for my employer in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Attached hereto please find the XX/XX/XXXX approval letter of my XXXX ECF ( entitled "" XXXX PSLF EC Acknowledgment and Payments '' ), which summarizes all of my nearly 5 years of qualifying PSLF payments made thus far, as well as the internal communication between the Department of Education and FedLoan that initially led to approval of my employer as qualifying for the PSLF program ( entitled "" FOIA-PRODUCTION-US-Department-of-Education-on-PSLF-1-pdf - ICC Discussion '' ).

This year, however, I submitted my ECF on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached hereto as "" XXXX Public Service Loan Forgiveness Application - SIGNED '' ) and received a reply from FedLoan on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached hereto as "" FedLoan Servicing Reply to XXXX ECF - XXXX '' ) stating that FedLoan needs additional time to determine if I work for a qualifying employer and meet all other criteria for the PSLF -- even though my employer and other credentials have been certified/approved for PSLF by FedLoan ( in consultation with the Department of Education ) for the past five years without issue. It is worth noting that my employer 's non-profit status, stated mission, and governance model have not changed in the slightest since my initial employment date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to FedLoan via it's online chat service inquiring as to the status of its review of my XXXX ECF. I was provided a response containing very limited information and no estimated deadline by which I should expect to receive a response to my XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I again reached out to FedLoan via e-mail inquiring as to the status of its review of my XXXX ECF. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided a response containing very limited information and no estimated deadline by which I should expect to receive a response to my XXXX ECF. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to the Department of Education 's office of Federal Student Aid via e-mail inquiring as to the status of its review of my XXXX ECF. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided a response containing very limited information and no estimated deadline by which I should expect to receive a response to my XXXX ECF. I followed up to this reply on the same date with three very imperative questions, none of which I ever received a response to. Screenshots of all of this correspondence are attached hereto in chronological order as "" Correspondence with FedLoan Servicing and DOE ''. 

Since this last XX/XX/XXXX correspondence, I still have yet to receive any update or decision on my XXXX ECF, which was submitted nearly six ( 6 ) months ago. In years prior, it has generally taken FedLoan Servicing a few weeks to provide its approval of my annual ECF. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered an appealing full-time employment position that would not qualify for the PSLF program. I rejected said employment offer on the grounds that my current employer qualifies for PSLF and has qualified since XXXX, and pursuant to my completion of the PSLF program, I will obtain forgiveness of my six-figure student loan debt in XXXX.",None,AES/PHEAA,AL,35222,None,Consent provided,Web,07/24/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4571506

I crossed referenced with my records, the Federal Student Aid website and Credit Report that reports my balance as {$65000.00}. There is no interest being charged right now so i dont understand why this {$.00} appeared magically in my balance. 

I contacted Fedloan on XX/XX/21, The First person i spoke to said she had never seen this, so she transferred me to another person, which said the same, and then got transferred one last time. The Last person i spoke to said she had reached out to an specialist and said there hadn't been any changes done to my account, and that there was nothing to be done, and told me she would send me a statement of account through the mail, and told me to review and see if anything that didn't feel right to call back This is unacceptable, just raising your balance just because? The whole reason i called her was because i already found a discrepancy and all they did was to deflect.

The response from the Department of Education to my complaint is unacceptable. As noted in their response, interest would have been capitalized ( added to the principal balance ) after periods of forbearance or deferment, during the consolidation processes, and during the default/rehabilitation processes. The Departments practice of applying payments to past due interest first that has already been capitalized and included in the principal loan balance does not appear to be a fair, ethical practice, particularly since the loan continues to accrue interest on the unpaid principal during the same period. As stated in the Departments response XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX ( XXXX ) underlying XXXX XXXX Loans were involved in a consolidation process. The XXXX XXXX Consolidation Loan had an original principal balance of {$73000.00}. Yet, as of todays date, XX/XX/XXXX ( 17 years later ), they still show {$71000.00} as the current principal balance of the loan. 

I requested and received an updated Summary of Financial Activity from XXXX XXXX showing transactions from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, indicating a principal balance as of XX/XX/XXXX of {$71000.00}.

The principal balance I derived from those calculations ( INCLUDING capitalized interest totaling {$10000.00} ) was {$59000.00} NOT {$71000.00}.

I am writing because I have met all the requirements for loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program ( PSLF ). For the last ten years, I have been a social worker at an employer that qualifies under PSLF. PHEAA/FedLoan Servicing have processed payments for 9 out of 10 years ( 108 out of 120 eligible payments ) and acknowledged that my employer qualifies. As of XX/XX/2021, I have submitted a certification to PHEAA/FedLoan Servicing that I have made all 120 of the payments required to process my loan forgiveness and forgive the remaining balance of my loans. Since that time ( ie for the last ~5 months ), my application for loan forgiveness has been in limbo with PHEAA/FedLoan servicing. I follow up regularly through various available channels but am never able to get more than perfunctory answers to questions about when my loan will be processed for forgiveness. The most I am told, repeatedly, for months now, is that PHEAA/FedLoan Servicing needs to verify my employment with a qualified employer. However, as mentioned, I have been at the same employer for years, and PHEAA/FedLoan Servicing has, in each year except this last one, timely verified my employment and confirmed that the employer is qualified. As a result of PHEAA/FedLoan Servicings refusal to certify my most recent year of employment, I am administratively stuck on 108 out of the 120 eligible payments. I am particularly distressed because it is clear that PSLF applicants are being processed on a regular basis these days, but my application is being left behind for unclear reasons. I have fulfilled my obligations and responsibilities towards loan forgiveness under the PSLF Program over ten strenuous years in public service. I am hoping that you can use the influence of your office to help push my application through. Thank you again.

07/10/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In 2018, I enrolled as an online XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX student at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called my servicer, FedLoan, and explained that I was enrolling in this program and asked if taking out a small loan of about {$6000.00} would affect my account, credit towards public service loan forgiveness, or anything else. I was told no. I explained that I would continue to be working and making payments and expected for my months to continue to count towards PSLF while I went to school ONLINE in an accredited online program at a flagship institution designed for working professionals. What I was NOT told was that I would need to fill out waiver to remove any in-school deferment. I was not aware my account was placed in in-school deferment until after the XXXX XXXX XXXX had submitted notification to Department of ED and received by FedLoan that I was in school at least half time. In fact, I paid my XX/XX/2018 payment BEFORE FedLoan notified me they had placed my account in an in-school deferment and then FedLoan retroactively applied the in-school deferment on my account to include the entire month of XXXX, even after accepting a payment in full. 

I called FedLoan multiple times about this situation. I was told I had to fill out a waiver to remove the in-school deferment and have my payments counted. I submitted the waiver three times before the deferment was finally removed, in part, I believe, because FedLoan was repeatedly notified that I was in school. In short, this was all a continuous electronic process between my institution, the department of education, and FedLoan that removed me from notification processes and disallowed me from taking any proactive action to protect my account from the harmful impacts until after the electronic notifications and domino-effect actions had occurred! 

I included my start date on the waiver of XX/XX/2018 each time I submitted and intended for the waiver to cover any and all deferment periods. I NEVER asked for and took any direct action on my end to place my account in deferment!!! After the 3rd submission, FedLoan finally removed the in-school deferment, but only to the date of processing, excluding XXXX and XX/XX/2018 from the waiver of deferment. The impact to my account was my payment for XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018 being rendered an ineligible month for XXXX because, according to Fed Loan, "" You do not have a bill due for this payment period. You were not required to make any payments during the period for the following reasons : - in your grace period, in a deferment, in a forbearance. '' In fact, I did have a bill due for XXXX which was paid on time and in full. The deferment was retroactively applied by Fed Loan to include XX/XX/2018 ( a month they actually issued a bill that I paid in full ), after XXXX XXXX XXXX completed its notification. 

I want a review of my account for XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018, the 2 months, which I made on time in full payments that were named on my waiver for in-school deferment, included in my count for eligible payments towards XXXX ; because currently they are not! 

Additionally, I recommend an informed consent process be established so that students can opt-in or opt out of an in school deferment, especially for online students who may be working full time and seeking public service loan forgiveness while attending a program. This should not have been an automated process outside of my disclosure and outside of my ability to affect the outcome until the harm had been done.",None,AES/PHEAA,TN,38135,None,Consent provided,Web,07/10/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4531797

After completing my XXXX XXXX program, my deferment period was misrepresented to me by the servicer which resulted in damages to my credit. Additionally when I began to inquire about how many payments I have made towards my XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) program, the agent laughed at me stating I still had another 10 years of payments to make. He stated that I was either in the wrong repayment plan, or some other convoluted explanation. I spoke with several reps even after they damaged my credit for non-payment during what I assumed was a grace period because I had an extra semester of classes to complete. Since I wasn't "" Full time '' they tell me after-the-fact that this occurred and I was penalized for non-payment when I assumed it was deferred since I was still in classes for my master 's program.

I was enrolled, I applied myself attended my courses and was doing very well .. XXXX months into my schooling I was now scheduled for math classes and I was very unsettled as I specifically was told I would not have to particiate in any schedules that were math classes. I was out and out lied to. I contacted the school and the loan servicing company who is Great Lakes Borrowers in the mid west.. each entity referred me back to each other to where I was not getting any results whatsoever. I literally found myself reaching out to XXXX contacts across the globe to please help me get through this now mandated math course and classes I was scheduled against my will and against what I agreed to. Soon afterwards, I suffered a traumatic injury requiring XXXX. With being a mother of XXXX young children, and all that was going on, I chose to stop participating in my courses for college. Soon after this, I was being billed for student loan debt in the $ XXXX  range.XXXX now reaching debt due to interest accruing upwards of over XXXX at this time. I am in objection and disbute and have been for quite some time. I applied for student loan forgiveness and was denied. this was some time ago. Most recently, in or about XXXX of XXXX I literally borrowed money from someone to get this loan paid off because it was front and center on my credit report .. Once I went to pay for it.. I was so aggitated I called great lakes borrowers again to tell them. hey I paid this off ( I borrowed the funds to do so - and you need to once again know that I am in total objection to even owing this debt because I was utterly deceived and mislead and lied to from day one ) To my surprise, the Great Lakes Borrowers representative I spoke to ( my reason for calling was to immediately remove this off my credit report ) told me that I seriously should consider re-applying for Borrower 's defense.. and I responded that I did apply and was ultimately denied.. I was then informed that while that is true, there are now 'changes ' that now include being mislead and mis informed that are relative to my situation for which I originally claimed to get some relief.. are now being included and to re apply. So I did! I was given a borrower 's defense link, 24 pages long, filled it out, printed it, signed it and placed probably about a dozen stamps to a brown manila envelope and personally handed it to my usps mail carrier in XXXX of XXXX. Some time /weeks went by and I called XXXX XXXX XXXX my XXXX XXXX and was informed that there was a dispute filed under my ss number directly relating to this student loan debt.. I was like wow okay cool! someone got my application and forged on to start processing my plea for relief.. Upon reaching out to the dept of education.gov for student loans was shocked to be then told that they never received my application for borrower 's defense! I was like .. seriously? it wasnt ever returned to me by mail as being undeliverable! so someone got it and why would XXXX tell me that a dispute was filed XX/XX/XXXX? I never contacted XXXX directly myself. so someone had to have and it is DIRECTLY related to this federal student loan debt that I have profusely had conflict and objection to owing. I was never told I was taking out a loan in the first place.. I was actually told that due to my low income status that I qualified for schooling through college with a grant. so imagine my utter shock and upset .. both lied to about what courses I would be required to participate in as well as the loan /debt situation.. in addition being a victim of bogus help with employment once I graduated and got my certificate.. They were never able to guarantee this benefit.. and have since closed and gone bankrupt as a school.. When I called Great Lakes Borrowers, the rep said she alone has had over 30 complaints for students who were enrolled with XXXX University.. I did not know about that but it goes to support my debt situation here.. I am devastated.. This school loan has ruined my life and livelihood as far as being able to obtain credit so as to buy a home for myself and XXXX  children. I have additionally re-filled out the supposed non received application by the dept of education and where it got to the signature line, was prohibited from signing my name.. strange huh? so I chose to take the date variable input .. put my name and then the date to re-submit my application for relief.. to date I have not had any attention or response to my re-application for which I emailed them once again saying I sent my printed out application, filled out, signed and mailed via stamped manila envelope handing directly to my mail carrier in early XXXX and since it has not been returned as undeliverable, since it has been noted as a dispute with XXXX upon my calling about my credit report, I can only presume it's been received and otherwise .. placed in a circular trash can file. or burried and just ignored. Either way, I am very concerned as this student debt is NOT valid not justified and needs to be dissolved. I have tried every which way you can think of to plead my case and I seriously do not feel like I should be punished or penalized based on this specific situation and personal scenario I am plagued with unjustifiably. 

I need an advocate.. I need help! please help me.. please intervene on my behalf.

XXXX came and I had received no letter back from them and XX/XX/XXXX I proceeded to fax over a failure to respond. I received by email from them about a week later that they'd received my correspondence and would get back to me. I ended up calling and speaking with one of the representatives in XXXX who assured me my mail had not been sent to another address. She told me all correspondence had been mailed to my current address. By XX/XX/XXXX I'd finally gotten the documentation I'd originally asked for in XXXX. As well as confirmation that my mail had been sent to another address that is about 7yo. The letter also stated that I'd never updated my address with them however in XX/XX/XXXX they had my address when I initially asked about the account. Looking through the paperwork they'd sent me and what they'd sent to the other address my XXXX name and last 4 of my social security number was listed on multiple documents. The bank did not do its part in protecting my information. I have no idea who lives at the address where they sent my mail to. I feel I was lied to when the lady I spoke with assured me no mail had been sent there. This irresponsibility has set me back for an additional 3 months due to waiting on documents as well as the potential for someone to use my information to obtain credit in my name. My address was updated with them as of XX/XX/XXXX. I have since had to place a lock on all accounts in hopes to stop potential use of my information. This action costs money of course. It was my thought that according to FCRA responses to consumers should be within 30-45 days. I called the credit Bureau as well who advised of what actions to take. They also provided confirmation that the address used by Wells Fargo is also not listed on my credit report. XXXX is well beyond the 45 day mark and I am hoping to have some resolution regarding this issue.

10/07/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to request for your assistance in addressing issues with my public service loan forgiveness payments with Fedloan servicing ( PHEAA ). 

Problem # 1 - I was placed on excessive administrative forbearance of 4 months from XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX when applying for an income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plan when typically it takes 1 month to process the repayment application. I lost months of public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ) qualifying payments. 

Just to give a little background- I graduated from medical school in XX/XX/XXXX, had a 6 month grace period XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX during which time I have consolidated my direct subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans with the intention of pursuing PSLF. At that time, my direct loans were with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My first repayment should have started in XX/XX/XXXX, but I was not informed to file an IDR repayment application before XX/XX/XXXX and once I filed the IDR form in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX gave me a timeline of up to 2 months for processing time. Once the IDR application was processed, my first bill was generated in XX/XX/XXXX on the IBR plan. My loans were subsequently transferred to Fedloan Servicing in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX has since been closed. 

Problem # 2 - During my annual IDR recertification in XX/XX/XXXX, Fedloan servicing placed me on administrative forbearance and Fedloan servicing automatically transferred my repayment plan from PAYE to REPAYE without my knowledge and without giving me an opt out option so that I can make my normal repayment under my then PAYE plan. 

Fedloan servicing said that they automatically transferred me to REPAY because I did not qualify for PAYE. I already lost one month of repayment when my IDR plan was switched from IBR to PAYE in XX/XX/XXXX and now I lost another month again because Fedloan servicing realized that they mistakenly approved me for the PAYE plan. Fedloan unilaterally placed me on administrative forbearance, switched my repayment plan, failed to offer me an opt out plan, and failed to inform me of this whole undertaking in XX/XX/XXXX. Fedloan 's service recovery team agent realized the error of not giving me an opt out option and filed for a review since XX/XX/XXXX for a bill to be retroactively generated, but there has been no remedy since the escalation.",None,AES/PHEAA,NY,11215,None,Consent provided,Web,10/07/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4788776

Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

I re-certified my income year after year to remain on this IBR plan and collected my Employer Verification forms for the ten years that I have continuously worked for 501 ( c ) 3 organizations as instructed by my loan servicer, which is now Navient. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to submit those Employer Verification forms through studnetloans.gov as instructed by Navient but the system did not allow to do so.

On XX/XX/XXXX, after speaking to a customer service representative at XXXX and still being told there was no record of me in their system, I was transferred to a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Specialist in the organization who notified me that a denial letter for my application to the PSLF program had been sent to an old address that had been on an Employer Verification form from a previous employer. She stated over the phone that my application had been denied because I had failed to consolidate my Stanford loans into Direct loans when I originally began my income-based repayment in XXXX. However, never between XXXX and XXXX had I been notified by Navient that I needed to consolidate my loans into Direct loans in order to participate in the program, even though I had inquired to make sure I was on track with the PSLF program throughout my 10 years on IBR.

I asked the representative from XXXX to send the denial letter to my current address, and it is attached here.

I was working in a public school during this time so my employment was qualifying employment. My plan was to work for 10 years, from XXXX in public service and have my remaining loan balance forgiven. I noticed after a year of payments that my payments from XXXX stopped showing as qualified and many of my payments weren't actually being processed as qualifying payments due to the way that the XXXX system did not always sent payments in a timely manner and was impossible to contact and told me there was nothing else they could do. I spoke to fedloan on a monthly basis to confirm my payment was received and would qualify and always submit payment requests on time and per fedloan and was given mixed information regularly. I was told my account was under review for 3 years and that the payments should show up as qualifying once the review was complete. The review is still pending. It has been 5 years now. 

I have been paying my loans on time since XX/XX/XXXX ( 49 months ) and only have 18 months of qualifying payments.

This is a predatory practice because all federal student loans are already temporarily in a government mandated Forbearance, and in a 0 % interest period due to the pandemic. It is highly unethical to change students over to forbearance for financial hardship -of which you are only permitted to use for a total of three years during the lifetime of your loan repayment under normal circumstances, when the federal government has automatically put loans into this state which will not be subject to the same limitations.

01/20/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"Nelnet Servicing , LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nelnet Diversified Solutions LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nelnet Inc ( collectively Nelnet ). Nelnet administers, services and collects student loans throughout the United States. In addition to privately owned debt, NelNet contracts with the federal Department of Education regarding the administration and collection of student loans owned by the Department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from my credit monitoring service that late payments had been reported on my credit report. Upon investigation the late payment reporting came from NelNet, a company I had never heard of. Upon contacting NelNet I was told that my federal student loans had been purchased in XXXX from my prior loan servicer and then almost immediately put into deferment. When speaking to XXXX customer service provider XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told multiple times that my loan would be put in further forbearance to make me current. I had told her multiple times during the conversation I would not have trouble paying and could pay the amount in full. XXXX was insistent that my loans be placed in forbearance, despite my ability to pay, until I asked to speak to her supervisor. The language she was using and insistence on forbearance appeared to come from a script. 
Upon being transferred to XXXX supervisor XXXX, I explained my ability to pay and the circumstances that led to NelNets reporting on my credit. After explaining that I would pay the amount in full, I asked that the late payment be removed as I had never received contact from NelNet ( including notice of their becoming my loan servicer, that any amounts were late, that payments were due during CARES Act forbearance ), and that studentaid.gov the only method that would have been available for me to see the loan showed no amount due. XXXX stated that by federal law it was illegal to remove NelNets credit reporting. XXXX then advised me not to attempt any dispute as it could further harm my credit. 

Later in the evening I called NelNet a third time asking for a copy of the Master Promissory Note from XXXX, and a copy of all attempted contact from XXXX to myself. The only contact attempted by NelNet was a letter from XX/XX/XXXX explaining a repayment schedule that was sent to an address I am not familiar with. When I explained to NelNet that there was no way for me to know that they were now my loan provider, and that no notices of any pending payments were sent, I was told that I should have kept my information current on Studentaid.gov. My information was correct on studentaid.gov and had never to my knowledge shown the address used by NelNet, and was correct since at least the time NelNet became my loan servicer. 

I believe NelNet violated federal provisions that apply to servicers of FFELP loans. Following are a descriptions of the laws I believe applied to my loans and the subsequent credit reporting. 

Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 contains several provisions that pertain to student loan servicing, one such provision is 20 U.S.C. 1082 which applies to FFELP loans. The Education department has promulgated several servicing-related regulations under its rulemaking authority under Title IV of the HEA. Nearly all of these regulations are codified in Part 682 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which governs FFELP loans. 682.208 ( c ) ( 2 ) provides that [ w ] hen a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower or a student loan borrower is no longer enrolled at an institution of higher educationsthe lender shall promptly contact the borrower in order to establish the terms of repayment. 682.208 ( e ) ( 1 ) provides information, that in the event of the assignment or transfer of ownership interest of a Stafford loan results in a change in the identity of the servicer, certain information must be provided. This information includes notice of the assignment and the effective date of the assignment or transfer of the loan. 682.208 ( g ) provides that if during a period when the borrower is not delinquent, a lender receives information indicating it does not know the borrowers address, it may commence the skip-tracing activities specified in 682.411 ( h ). 

34 CFR 682.411 describes the due diligence in collecting guaranty agency loans. 682.411 ( b ) states that delinquency begins on the first day after the due date of the first payment that is not later made. 682.411 ( c ) ( 1 ) states that for accounts 1-15 days delinquent, the lender must send at least one written notice or collection letter to the borrower informing the borrower of the delinquency. 682.411 ( d ) describes due diligence efforts for loans 16-180 days delinquent. ( d ) ( 1 ) provides that during 16-180 days the lender must engage in at least four diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone and sent at least four collection letters, with at least one effort to contact the borrower by telephone before the 90th day of delinquency.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",DC,20003,None,Consent provided,Web,01/20/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4079562

02/11/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I will make this short in hopes that someone will actually read it. This concerns FedLoan Student Loan Servicing for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I am qualified government employee who has made more than 120 qualifying payments. This has been an absolute nightmare for 14 years and that nightmare continues. Every chance that FedLoan has had to make things difficult or to manipulate the process they have taken advantage of that opportunity. Last year they notified me that I had reached my 120 payments and was qualified for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Considering their track record, I absolutely did not trust them. I spoke with multiple reps who advised me that it was time for me to apply for forgiveness. I was even told not to worry about my past problems and all the news stories about FedLoan, that my account was a perfect example. I applied for forgiveness and continued to call every few weeks to make certain that I had done everything and that the process was moving along. I was told more than once that it was good and they were just waiting to hear back from the Department of Education and that it could take up to 120 days. In a little less than 90 days I received notice that I had been rejected because I had not made 120 qualifying payments. I had in writing from FedLoan before I even applied that I had made 120 qualifying payments. I spoke with customer service who informed me that they had no idea why it was rejected because I had indeed made the payments and they would request a review of the file. I was told that this review would normally take 6 months but could be more considering a backlog. I have no idea if this review will ever actually take place. I am now trapped and under their control. This isnt the first time I have been left out in the cold by FedLoan. I made payments that didnt count because I was paying {$300.00} when I should have been paying {$0.00} on different plan even after asking for advise. I lost payments because I paid extra one month to cover the next month, and they didnt have the appropriate box checked for that to count as a payment. Just today I see an article in Forbes where FedLoan is settling with borrowers in Massachusetts because of these exact practices. I live in Alabama, I am out of luck, but I feel like I am dealing with a loan shark. I am not a freeloader. I have never been without a job since I was XXXX years old. I dont want free college, but I took and kept a public service job based on this program. I was offered this and I fulfilled my end of the bargain and FedLoan is doing everything they can do avoid handling their portion of the deal. They are even admitting that it must be a mistake on their end that they might review this year. FedLoan can be downright sadistic and cruel to people who are trying to do the right thing. It is a shame that America has allowed a company to do this to its citizens. I have done everything that I can think to do outside of hiring a team of attorneys that would cost more than the student loans themselves. Any advice or assistance that could be provided would be appreciated. I will be glad to provide all of my account information.

02/16/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Confusing or misleading advertising,"Dear Friends at CPFB, I graduated from college back in XXXX  and soon after the Public Service Loan Forgiveness act was passed. I was very excited to hear about this program since I was over {$20000.00} in debt and excited to start my career as a woefully underpaid XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Graduating college while working full time was a huge and maddening endeavor on its own. Immediately after graduation, I then began scattering to find a job in my chosen career so that I can put my education to good use for the children of this nation and, hopefully, all of mankind. 

At some point after graduation and when the FSLP was being signed into law, I began getting phone calls from Citibank and put them off several times until, one day, I happened to have time to hear their sales pitch. They were very excited about the current low interest rates at the time and made me feel like it would be foolish not to consolidate my Federal Direct loans immediately, while the rates were so very low. 

I was young, naive, and this was my very first time owing money to anyone at all. I was overwhelmed at the time, very concerned about how I was going to afford the payments on this massive loan, and had zero experience in the real world. It sounded like it would really simplify my life and save me lots of money in the long term. I thought nothing of it and, of course, did it.

About 12 years later, I was so excited to finally hand in all the paperwork for my PSFL. I had worked tirelessly as an underpaid public servant and made my 120 payments only to find out that the loan that I now have ( that has since been transferred from Citibank to XXXX ) is not eligible for PSFL and that I would have to switch to a Federal Direct loan and start my ten years worth of service and payments all over again. 

I recently saw that the CPFB helped to find multiple legal violations on the part of Citibank, where they were fined a great deal of money. I greatly appreciate your agencys efforts in fighting for the people and truly hope that I can find similar recompense for this offense that I have encountered. 

I have a sneaking suspicion and strong belief that Citibank ( possibly in cahoots with our own government ) made a concerted effort to get young and naive new graduates to consolidate their loans in order to make sure that the loan never needed to actually be forgiven down the road. I was wondering if this was an issue that has ever been brought up by others and if there are any avenues for recourse for someone in my position. 

I guess that ultimately, I did not do my due diligence to assure that the loan consolidation was truly right for me. I wish that I was more wise and jaded back then and maybe I could have identified this rouse before being tricked like I was. But doesnt it seem odd that the interest rates happened to go way down immediately after the PSFL bill was passed and then immediately after, Citibank starts making relentless sales calls to lure people out of their direct loans. 

At the time, I was young and idealistic and would never expect the world to do such things to people, but now I feel like I have learned a lot more about the sad state of affairs in the profit at all cost financial system we live in and the whole thing sure seems like foul play to me.

All in all I am extremely disheartened to learn that I dedicated over ten years of my life in service of the public believing, all along, that I would be rewarded for my tireless efforts. I am tempted to just stop paying the loans, simply on principle and to give up my career in public service for more lucrative employment because I am seriously jaded and angry. I dont believe that this was the intended result when the lawmakers of the time passed this bill but, thus, here we are. 

I believe that I have affected and improved the lives of hundreds of children during my years as a XXXX  XXXX  and I would like to continue to do so. I am just at a crossroad now with my first child and a new partner who has XXXX boys of her own and it just feels like I may not be able to continue working for the insulting wages that teachers are paid in most of the country .... especially not after being as wickedly duped as I truly believe I have been. 

Any support or guidance in this matter is so very appreciated.

XX/XX/XXXX, a large amount ( {$35000.00} ) was sent to Navient. It turns out it did not cover the full pay off amount. I owed {$140.00}. That's fine, because I assumed {$490.00} that was scheduled to come out through the rate production program would cover it in for XXXX 's payment ( XXXX XXXX ). Instead, of taking out XXXX, {$800.00} was taken out. I tried to call Navient, when I saw an email the day before it came out, but the offices were closed due to the Christmas holiday. I called Navient the following morning, they stated that through the recorded phone calls I did agree to the large payment, but my account was weird because it actually wasn't ending until the next month ( something about the covid forbearance ). That phone call prompted Navient to send me an email that the rate production was ending but that I would be refunded for XXXX. ( That was the difference between XXXX and XXXX. ) However, I noticed that although I had one more month in the rate reduction program, my original interests were high again. That shouldn't have happened until XXXX. I called a customer service rep, she agreed with me, and this would be adjusted. I've asked for documentation to show that. But no documents they provided me ever show that I received the low interest rate for the month of XXXX. 

Also, the {$300.00} payment was refunded on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement from Navient, that may balance was {$0.00}. I have that statement to show for. There was a balance showing, and I called a few times trying to confirm that there wasn't an additional balance. I was advised that I should probably wait because there were things being done in the background on my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a refund for this specific loan for {$18.00} and another refund on XX/XX/XXXX for {$210.00}. I'm assuming that's fine too, and something must have been overpaid with the XXXX check. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I have screenshot showing that Navient states I only have 2 loans. 

Fast forward to late early XX/XX/XXXX, the loan that I thought was gone reappears. I never received any statement, calls, anything. I call Navient trying to figure out how was that possible. How did I receive 2 refund checks if I actually owed a balance? My account and information was forwarded to a research department. I never heard back on where this amount came from and why I received refund if it actually wasn't paid I full. 

I paid the remaining {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX because I was not hearing a response from Navient and did not want interest to accrue. 

It is not acceptable to send a statement with a {$0.00} balance, remove a loan, and then add it back with no acknowledgement that this happened.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CT,06002,None,Consent provided,Web,02/12/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4137623

The actual Debtor is THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, holding the Creditor who is XXXX XXXX King/Brooks responsible for a fictitious Debt. Being an American Woman on the land and soil on Georgia for about 44 years and knowing that me personally doesnt have debt. The XXXX XXXX scam has gone on for us ( Americans ) in the United States for 4 or more generations. I am an American State National with rights to make sure that I am not charged for the Debts, taxes for the Corporations and I am not a State Citizen, a Federal United States Citizen, or a Territorial United States Citizen, nor a Municipal Citizen of the United States. In which they thought in XXXX the Corporations Act was ratified but it wasnt it is a shame that we have to fight with Corporations who feel that they hold the key to your future but in essence they do not. The only way that big corporations will be able to understand that XXXX XXXX KING/BROOKS is not the XXXX of the state for big business to kick around with no real cause for the abuse that has been hurled my way. Our government has been in abeyance for 150 years and Americans have been dumbed down and not paying attention to what was going on for more years than that. TXXXX XXXX XXXX reporting agencies know that my name is not XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they as well as any corporation can twist me up and have me the living woman enter twined with a dead thing. This has been done for quite some time and it is going to stop. A wet ink signature has to be shown to the living woman and her purported corporations. 

There are different laws governing contracts nothing has been implied or a unilateral contract which is with myself and nobody else. The impersonation/fraud has to stop now and I dont have any contracts with THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION and their Duns number is XXXX AND XXXX XXXX XXXX. I need the living man to show that contract. It has to be an equitable exchange there is none. The Purported Government is saying I have to pay taxes on the Student Loans but there is no law requiring an American to pay Income taxes on their earnings from the time I worked in XXXX to XXXX. But taxes have been paid and The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Duns number ( XXXX ) has zero authority to collect anything but they took XXXX out of my Social Security which has to be returned as well as all of the taxes that were paid to IRS, saying it was taken for purposes of paying the tax to THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Misappropriation of our labor and the I have included my birth certificate ( which is void for fraud ) along with several other documents to show that my given name was considered a PERSON/CORPORATION and not a living breathing woman. I want this Chief Executive Officer ( XXXX XXXX ) to come to court and testify that I am a CORPORATION, he needs to testify for GREAT LAKES, and say that I the woman owe this CORPORATION money, there is not money. Only Credit Because the Federal Reserve is a Private for profit CORPORATION and the only way that it can be paid is by gold and silver. They have been getting away with the sig norage of the XXXX dollar value of XXXX cents leaving XXXX cents profit and the XXXX dollar profit of XXXX for quite some time this is a very bad situation for the injury that has been suffered for quite some time as an impersonation scheme. The Debt was sent to GREAT LAKES, three times and has not been set off yet, and I am wondering what is clear about this debt being the XXXX XXXX/XXXX debt and not the living womans because living people dont have debt. This has been going on for a while and all of the questions have to be answered about the criminality and so how is this going to come to an end. It is going to have to go to court and everybody has to be transparent in dealing with the American Nationals and the CORPORATIONS. 








My mutual offset credit exemption exchange should be done like I asked them to do previously, and they are not doing what I have asked. So the judge will want to know why not, and knowing I am owed at least XXXX XXXX dollars since birth.

Let 's get this straight -- the members of any "" Congress '' convened in its Territorial or Municipal capacity never had any authority to make such a claim, not in XXXX, not in XXXX, and not today. There is absolutely no shred of valid interest involved here, no contract, no equitable consideration, no vested authority, and certainly no consent I have one contract with YOU the Constitution and I am owed the protections enumerated in the Constitution YOU that are sworn to uphold to protect my rights.

02/17/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have been paying off my loans based on the income based repayment ( IBR ) plan for more than 10 years. My loan servicer has been changed 4 times prior to being transferred finally to MyFedLoan as per my request in XX/XX/XXXX. Previously, all servicers were changed without my approval/request nor warning. My previous loan servicers are as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I have records of all previous servicers from XXXX and the amount paid during the times with each, but not the specific bills my new servicer ( MyFedLoan ) references in their counts of my loans. 

Recently, I requested transfer of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX, as I was coming up on the necessary 120 payments for the public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. It took approximately 6 months for this request to be completed and in XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred. Upon transfer to MyFedLoan, I realized many loan payments were missing, labeled ineligible due to you do not have a bill due for this payment period ( previously stated no bill ) and/or not reviewed at all. I should note, I did in fact receive bills monthly for all of these payment labeled you do not have a bill due for this payment period, as I would not have made payments otherwise. I was never on an automatic payment plan. I also complied with the yearly income recertification information with all servicers. 

I have called MyFedLoan numerous times since XX/XX/XXXX, and each time have been given different information by the agent or different suggestions on which actions I should take next to rectify this issue/clarify the issue. Many agents can not even clarify what "" no bill '' or you do not have a bill due for this payment period actually means or why payments are ineligible.

Now, according to the last 3 agents, I am under treasurer review and they are unable to fully comment on my account. The last agent suggested I upload any information from my previous servicers, which I completed. One even suggested I upload 10 years of bank statements to prove payment, which I will happily do if this would truly help. I uploaded the manual count I requested from XXXX prior to the transfer of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX, which shows I have completed 117 payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. Initially I was told a treasurer review would be quick since I was technically close to the 120 payments, yet the last agent I spoke to stated this could take 6-12 months to be completed. 

In addition to this, agents have told me I have many periods of forbearance listed on my account. A few of these I understand are from when my servicer was switched but many are not and were not approved or requested by me either. 

As I continue to check my account, I have now seen some previous payments which were listed as eligible are now not, without explanation or notification. I have also received concerning information from the last agent I spoke to asking if I "" wanted to set up an online account '' which I already have had for months. When asked what he meant, he stated it was likely a "" computer issue '' that he could not see my account and not to worry about my information being mishandled. 

At this point I do not know when my treasurer review will be completed and/or what that all entails. Communication of changes has been poor. Explanations of my account when I ask specific questions are met with uncertainty or different explanations by different agents. One agent stated he knows the process is confusing and at times is even confused himself - how can I possibly be sure I am receiving correct information if an agent says this to me, or be reassured that my account is accurately being handled correctly. This process is becoming frustrating and infuriating as I have completed all necessary payments and steps for this program, which was originally developed to help those who work for non-profit agencies in order to help with loan repayment.",None,AES/PHEAA,NJ,08054,None,Consent provided,Web,02/17/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4145802

My fiance and I was looking to purchase a home together but I don't qualify because of a {$300000.00} debt.

The Representative told me that this denial was due to the fact that I submitted my TEPSLF request prior to having a PSLF denial on file, which was a mistake. He said I did everything right and that he could not explain why this happened and apologized for the error. I asked to speak with a Supervisor. When I asked the Supervisor if my TEPSLF application could be re-activated or back-dated, to keep my place in line, I was told that was not possible.

Just two days later on XX/XX/XXXX I received my first email stating that my loans were falling into delinquency, followed by more on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, not to mention the incessant phone calls to not only me but my mother and my grandmother, who are both cosigners on my loans, as well as threatening letters in the mail. It was on XX/XX/XXXX that the "" good faith payment '' was officially taken out of my bank account and paid to the company. On XX/XX/XXXX, however, I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX at Sallie Mae, stating that he was calling from corporate and that he had a very urgent matter that he needed to discuss with me and that I was to call him back at XXXX. I called the number that evening when I got home from work and was put through to, not XXXX, but a woman ( whose name I unfortunately did not catch at the time ) who explained that her goal was to get my account up to balance. I explained to her that I was on the graduate repayment program and had made the good faith payment, which I had been assured would bring it back up to standing. Upon checking my account, she relayed to me that there had been some complication with my application, though she did not tell me what this was, and that it was resubmitted on XX/XX/XXXX, of which I was not notified nor was my approval given. She apologized profusely, explicitly stating that it was at the fault of Sallie Mae that I was still receiving calls, emails, and letters, and that everything would be taken care of and smoothed out within the next two or three days. This, however, was not the case, as I still continued to receive emails on XXXX and XXXX. It was on XXXX that I actually made my first payment of the {$450.00}, three days earlier than was due, and I received five payment confirmation emails, one for each of my loans. Later that same day, however, I received a threatening email stating that my loans were going to be reported as delinquent to the consumer reporting agencies on XXXX, and a letter stating the same thing came in the mail two days later. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to see what happening, as clearly there was some kind of miscommunication happening somewhere that I was not aware of, as I had done everything they had instructed me to do, and yet things had not been taken care of as had been promised on their end. On this call, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, who, once again, informed me that his goal was to help me being my account up to balance, and I let him know everything that had happened in the past month, between the incessant harassment and Sallie Mae not recognizing that I am on this program for reasons unbeknownst to me. He told me that he spoke with a supervisor and was the second person now to let me know that it was an error on the part of Sallie Mae, apologizing and assuring me that everything would be taken care of and updated. I gave him permission to reallocate the funds properly as, for some reason, this had not been done yet, and asked if this would still be going on my credit to which I was told that everything would be retracted. However, it is difficult to trust their word at this point, as the previous two times that I was assured everything had been taken care of and that my account would be brought up to balance, neither were followed through. At this point, I feel harassed even though I have done my due diligence.

No agent or representative of -and including- the department of education can provide me with a copy of my Promissory Note. The 2 colleges I attend do NOT have a copy of my promissory note. XXXX  does NOT have a copy of my promissory note. There have been a string of 'debt loan servicers ' handling my student loans.

Through no fault of my own, my student loan debt has been sold/transferred multiple times.

You have to look at this like : the toe bone is connected to the foot bone. The foot bone is connected to the leg bone and on & on. 
As near as I can gather, I signed documents in XXXX of XXXX to consolidate my student loans into an income driven repayment plan. The total debt -at that time- was around XXXX . At that time, the debt collector was XXXX XXXX. Through no fault of my own, one day, XXXX 'sold or transferred ' my loans to XXXX XXXX I don't know why the transfer/sale happened but it was NOT because of anything I did i.e., default. At the time of the sale/transfer from XXXXXXXX XXXX to XXXX my student loans were in good standing. 
When the loans were transferred to XXXX the interest on my debt was capitalized. Some time later, XXXX went bankrupt and went out of business. At that time my student loan debt, still in good standing, was sold/transferred to XXXX. At the time of this 2nd transfer, the interest on my loans was capitalized. While my loans were with XXXX, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I entered the Public Service Forgiveness Loan Program. All this time, my loan was status was in good standing. All of a sudden, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX went bankrupt and out of business. At that time, my student loans were transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and 'XXXX XXXX ' capitalized the interest on my loans. IN ADDITION XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  did NOT continue to keep my student loans in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and instead had me sign up/enroll/register in a new 'income driven repayment plan ' and at that time XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX capitalized the interest on my student loans. 
In XXXX of XXXX I became unemployed and homeless. My loans defaulted. About a year or so later, I went through a rehabilitation program, where the interest on my student loans were again, capitalized. After about 6 months of regular payments, my loans came out of rehabilitation and were transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where, again, the interest on my student loans was capitalized.

In XXXX of XXXX I applied to transfer my student loans back into the Public Service Foregiveness Program. I began applying for this 're-entry ' to the public service loan program in XXXX of XXXX. Finally in XXXX of XXXX, I was given notice that my student loans were going to be transferred into the public service foregiveness program and that my student loans had been transferred to XXXX XXXX  ', ... when XXXX XXXX got my student loans they also, capitalized the interest on my student loans.

I noted that my ACS principal balance did not appear to be declining according to my own schedule ( even assuming no excess payments were applied to the principal ).

XX/XX/XXXX : Loans were transferred from ACS to XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, ACS showed my principal balance to be $ XXXX.This value in itself was not correct. This can be proven by plugging the initial loan terms into an amortization calculator. Assuming no extra payments ( ever ), my balance should have been about {$81000.00}. In addition, according to a policy I was aware of, my extra payments were not being applied to the principal. They were used to advance my due date.

In XXXX I filed for bankruptcy and this loan was listed. My bankruptcy was granted. Somehow, the loan was put into XXXX 's name. XXXX was a senior citizen and I feel she was pressured with unethical collection tactics by Wells Fargo when they contacted her during my bankruptcy process. 

The student loan payments have been debited from my checking account for years despite the loan being discharged. Irrespective of that, Wells Fargo will not put the loan back in my name even though they are being paid by me. This is causing XXXX a significant amount of upset as a senior citizen. 

To date, I have paid well over {$19000.00} on this loan and possibly already paid in full. Yet, apparently there is {$5000.00} owed which if the loan is even valid is an incorrect amount since the total loan amount is {$21000.00}. 

I feel that Wells Fargo should have written off this loan due to my bankruptcy. I am requesting your assistance in having the remainder of this loan waived, or seek recovery for money paid from XXXX to the present. I am attaching the Wells Fargo file, and my latest payment to Wells Fargo from my XXXX  XXXX XXXX checking account.

After talking with XXXX they agreed to place me on hardship payments. Discover neglected to tell me that the payments were only in place for three months. Discover made no attempt to contact me at any point from the end of these hardship payments. 

This XXXX, hoping to settle the balance, I called Discover. I spoke to an individual named XXXX, who informed me that Discover was willing to settle the account for a lower amount. Hoping to get the loan off of my account, I was incredibly motivated to reach an agreement. Unfortunately, Discover wanted roughly XXXX, which was more than I had at the time. I told Discover I would contact them within a week to let them know if I could make XXXX work on my end, while XXXX said she would try to get a lower settlement number. 

I since made numerous attempts to contact XXXX. Every time I was told that she was unavailable. I was hoping to specifically talk to XXXX, as me and her had built up a good report and I had had negative experiences in the past with other Discover personnel. 

Today, I again attempted to call XXXX. Instead, I was told by Discover that my debt had been sent to a collection agency with no notice.

03/01/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am filing this formal complaint with your bureau regarding Wells Fargo Education Financial Services ( WFEFS ). WFEFS is engaged in unfair, deceptive and abusive practice in violation of Sections 1031, 1036 of Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) and 12 U.S.C. 5531 and 5536. 
In XXXX, I applied for private student loan with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX approved me for {$27000.00}. In XXXX of XXXX, I received a letter from WFEFS, informing me that they have taken over the private student loans from Campus Door and I should make the monthly payments as agreed to WFEFS. As soon as the loan in question when into repayment, I started submitting payments online to WFEFS. I have been making payments for the past 9 or more years but the payments were not applied to the principal amount at all. WFEFS is charging me interest on a daily basis which is then compounded. This causes me to pay interest on top of interest with no possibility of bringing the loan amount down. I am paying what WFEFS is requiring me to pay, and at no point I was given an option to pay a different amount to bring my principal down. In addition, why isnt the interest going down? I have tried to get a clarification pertaining to the allocation of my monthly payments from Wells Fargo and every time I call, a representative started talking about interest being compounded and its daily accrual. Even if the interest were to accrue daily, it still does not make sense why my principal balance keeps increasing despite the payments I have been making. In addition, the payments that I have been making are the required payments to keep my account current. If they continue this type of practice, I will never be able to pay this loan off ; unless I pay the whole amount all at once. I do not have this problem with any other student loan company? This clearly shows that the conduct WFEFS is engaged in is unfair and abusive. 
Furthermore, WFEFS has unfairly and erroneously reported my account to the consumer credit bureaus for being 30 days or more late with my student loan payments in XXXX of XXXX ( XXXX and XXXX ) and in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). I have disputed the aforementioned discrepancy and error with WFEFS and the credit bureaus, but WFEFS does not seem to be willing to correct the error. WFEFS is in possession of the payment history showing that I was not 30 days late with my payments in XX/XX/XXXX and/or XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but WFEFS keeps ignoring that information. This action on WFEFSs part causes the credit bureaus to keep the negative and erroneous reporting on my credit report which has negatively impacted my credit score. 
In order to get the late payment reporting removed from my credit reports, I filed numerous disputes with the above-mentioned credit bureaus, but even they seem to be ignoring the payment history that I have submitted along with my disputes. The credit bureaus, instead of taking the evidence submitted by me, contacted WFEFS, and as usual, WFEFS provided them with the same incorrect information. I am not sure why these credit bureaus are relying on the information provided by a creditor that is not credible at all based on its track record handling student loan accounts in the past. 
Based on Wells Fargos inability or unwillingness to correct the error in credit reporting ; inability to explain the continuous increase in the principal loan amount, inability to properly explain the allocation of the payments made by me and their decision to let the account accrue interest daily and charging compounded interest, seems that they are again fraudulently taking advantage of an innocent student loan borrower like me. This is clearly unfair because WFEFSs conduct is causing me a substantial financial injury which I can not reasonably avoid, and which is not outweighed by counter-veiling benefits to me as a consumer. Additionally, WFEFSs conduct is abusive because it interferes with my ability to repay my student loan in a timely manner and understand the repayment structure of my student loan. My reasonable reliance on WFEFSs determination of the monthly payments amounts, causing WFEFS to benefit from it by maximizing their profits at my expense, is clearly unfair. This type of conduct is evidently abusive under the above-mentioned law. 
I am humbly requesting your bureau to step in and further investigate this matter. Only your assistance and investigation can help me to get out of this vicious payment cycle that WFEFS has created for me and to delete the unfair and erroneous credit reporting.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,95835,None,Consent provided,Web,03/03/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4174043

So, that is one problem.

The other issue is with the private loans through VSAC - Vermont Student Assistance Corporation. The original private loan was for {$61000.00} in XXXX when I graduated. I have currently made {$53000.00} in payments. So, assuming the APR was low, I would only have {$8100.00} remaining to pay.

So, VSAC would be earning {$43000.00} in interest on these loans. When I realized this was just a losing game and I couldn't pay any longer, I stopped paying during the Pandemic, and I offered {$15000.00} in settlement of the remaining debt, but they refused to accept a debt settlement amount and stated my only option was to participate in their "" Private Loan Rehabilitation Program '', which means no reduction in my overall balance, it just means I have to pay the same balance, which has been growing every month as they add more and more interest, and it just takes longer to pay it off. This not sustainable at all. I can not keep paying more and more every month for a debt that should be paid off with less than {$10000.00}!

When scheduling payments, Navient allows customers to select how they would like their payment to be allocated. I noticed in XX/XX/2021 that a payment I had specified be allocated to the loan ( s ) with the highest interest rate was seemingly allocated randomly across my various student loans rather than being allocated to the loan with the highest contractual interest rate. I reached out to Navient who indicated that, due to the provision of the CARES Act which reduced the interest rate for all student loans to 0 % for a period of time, payments which customers asked to be allocated to the loan with the highest interest were instead being allocated to the loan with the highest monthly payment amount. A copy of the correspondence in which they provided this information is attached. There is absolutely no indication on the website that this is the case. I have made payments throughout the period during which mandatory payments were suspended in order to get ahead on paying off my student loans and I now suspect that all payments I have made over the past 12 months have been misallocated, despite my explicit instructions to apply to the loan with the highest interest rate. I am confident Im not the only customer who was under the impression that payments would continue to be allocated to the loans with the highest pre-CARES Act interest rate during this forbearance period. 

Whats more, I believe the statement that payments are allocated to the loan with the highest payment amount is also misleading given that all loans currently show a monthly payment amount of {$0.00} due to the suspension of payments provided by the CARES Act. If this was the case, by their own logic any payment should be split evenly between my various loans. Instead, when I schedule a payment online and specify that it be allocated to the loan with the highest interest rate, I can see through the allocation preview that the payment is in fact being allocated to the loans with the lowest interest rates.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,60640,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/04/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4184112

I have made several student loan payments to FedLoan Servicing that are not showing as being qualified. Many of these payments were made while being employed by two PSLF-qualifying employers between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted certification forms for these two employers to FedLoan, most recently on XX/XX/XXXX and have not yet heard back. I see that, in the time that I've been waiting for a response to my XX/XX/XXXX form submission, my qualifying payment total has increased but is not completely accurate. I see three issues : 1. When I was employed by one of the PSLF-qualifying employers, I made payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. This is a total of 13 payments, and none of these payments are showing as being qualified.

2. While employed by another PSLF-qualifying employer, I made payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. This is a total of 28 payments, but only 24 of these payments ( from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX XXXX are showing as being qualified. This leaves 4 payments ( from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ) as not showing as being qualified. 
3. I have made consistent student loan payments while being employed by my current PSLF-qualifying employer from XX/XX/XXXX until present. There is 1 student loan payment ( for XX/XX/XXXX ) that is not showing as being qualified.

Apparently, this did not apply to my private student loan. 

This company, Mohela, has put me in financial dire straights before, forced me into bankruptcy, and caused immense amounts of stress on my family due to their horrible communication practices and unwillingness to assist in any way. 

In XXXX, I filed for bankruptcy under pressure from a defaulted student loanwith Mohela. This student loan had fallen into bad standing as I had called Mohela to file for an economic forbearance option and was not informed I had only placed this option on the federal student loan held by Mohela, not the private student loans they also serviced. 

I came out of bankruptcy in XXXX, expecting to have accounts reset and be able to start with a fresh slate, and Mohela had not done any of these things as my other accounts with other creditors had. My forbearances were never reset, I was out of any available options when financial hardships arose, as they had already exhausted these options prior to and during the bankruptcy. 

When the bankruptcy period was over, and payments resumed for this loan, they were entirely too high for my family to afford. We contacted Mohela to put a payment adjustment in place, and they do for a time, but it expires, and each time, we file for a new modification. They want more and more information, and they do not contact us to tell us it's missing. You must log in to the website to find details. 

This year, as stated before, I erroneously thought this company would be giving us relief due to the pandemic, and instead, what they did could only be considered postal harassment. We tried to apply for a payment deferment in XXXX, a payment modification, anything to help get us through, and they denied us for missing income verification. 

Now we are receiving letters telling me I have defaulted on this loan, and to contact the legal department, during a global pandemic, during an unprecedented time, and during a time when student loans were supposed to be offering relief.

Although I had requested paperless/ email notifications, I was not sent an email notification at all. I called immediately and was prompted to make an online payment -- which I did on XX/XX/2020, this set up a recurring payment for XX/XX/2020 for the full amount due. I was told that this would cover the payments missed and prevent a report of delinquency to the credit bureau. Unfortunately, Heartland ECSI did in fact report this as a delinquency to the credit bureau. I called again, and inquired why this occurred, as I was told that the payment was made in time to avoid this credit issue. The representative I spoke with said that if I had made a One Time Payment on the day that I initiated the payment, it would have avoided the credit issue completely ; however since I was instructed to create a recurring payment ( that didn't go through until the 1st of the month, XX/XX/2020 ), this caused the payment to be a few days too late to avoid the credit reporting issue. This representative apologized for the misinformation from the previous representative, and she then informed me that I could take action to correct this issue and remove the delinquent notice on my credit. The representative sent me forms to apply for a forbearance. She said that this would resolve the issue and completely eliminate the delinquency on my credit. I filed for the forbearance as I was instructed and it was successfully applied to my account. Once the forbearance was active however, I noticed that the delinquency notice was still showing on my credit and my credit score was still significantly lower than prior to this notice. I called once again to Heartland ECSI, and inquired on why this was the case. The representative I spoke with stated that the previous representative was incorrect in the information she relayed to me regarding the forbearance. The representative said they could see the notes from that conversation, and he stated that a forbearance would have been able to resolve the credit issue if I did not make a payment at that time to cover the missed payments. He apologized for the misinformation that I had now received multiple times, and he said there was nothing they could do. My credit score went from XXXX to XXXX ( from the credit sources I checked ), and I now had a forbearance on my account due to the constant misinformation and lack of communication from Heartland ECSI. I would greatly appreciate if this issue could be resolved and corrected on my credit, as I was misguided by the incorrect information provided to me by Heartland ECSI.",None,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,TX,75002,None,Consent provided,Web,06/14/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4459146

04/30/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have a federal consolidated student loan that is serviced by Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency dba FedLoan Servicing. The loan was consolidated in XXXX, but FedLoan Servicing maintains the consolidated loan as two loan sequences : a subsidized student loan and an unsubsidized student loan. I have been an XXXX XXXX service member in the United States XXXXXXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. I have remained on XXXX XXXX at all times since XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have never requested for my loans to be placed in forbearance. However, FedLoan Servicing has placed my loans into forbearance on numerous occasions to process their own paperwork and for their own benefit. They have even retroactively applied forbearances to my account several years later to correct their own billing errors when I was in active repayment during that time period and both the Department of Defense and I were making payments towards my student loans. Every year of my XXXX XXXX service, I have filed a yearly certification form to determine my payment amount under an income-based repayment plan. Since the start of my XXXX service, I have been enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. I am in the Revised Pay As You Earn plan. The Department of Education reviews my income on a yearly basis and determines my monthly repayment amount based on my previous year 's tax information. I have also been periodically submitting requests to certify the number of qualifying payments towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I submitted an Employment certification form as recently as XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Department of Defense has made three lump sum payments directly to my loan principal on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX for {$15000.00}, XX/XX/XXXX for {$15000.00} and XX/XX/XXXX for {$15000.00}. 

I was incorrectly advised by FedLoan Servicing that when the Department of Defense made lump sum payments towards my loan principal, I was still required to make my monthly payments each month because their lump sum payment only counted as 1 payment for purposes of PSLF. I recently completed and submitted an Employment Certification form for PSLF XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). I noticed that Page 4 reads : "" You may also receive credit for qualifying payments if a lump sum payment is made on your behalf through a student loan repayment program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD ).. if a lump sum payment is made on your behalf through a DOD student loan repayment program, the Department will give you credit for qualifying payments equal to the lesser of ( 1 ) the number of payments resulting after dividing the amount of the lump sum payment by the monthly payment amount you would have made under one of the qualifying repayment plans listed below, or ( 2 ) 12 payments. "". Based on the DoE explanation of these lump sum payments, as of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I did not need to pay again for the next 12 months following a lump sum payment made to my loans by the Department of Defense. However, FedLoan Servicing incorrectly advised me that I was required to pay for everyone month because according to them the lump sum payment by the DOD only counted as 1 qualifying payment for PSLF. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( Complaint # XXXX ). In my complaint I stated : I would like a refund of all of the payments that I made in excess that I was not required to pay -- because they were already paid on my behalf by the DOD -- including specifically the payments made in... XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. FedLoan Servicing responded to my complaint and statedin partThe following payments covered by the lump sum payments from the DOD may be submitted by FLS to be refunded to you without decreasing your qualifying payment count : XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$34.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$6.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00}, XX/XX/XXXX for {$270.00} and XX/XX/XXXX for {$270.00}. These total {$4000.00}. These refunds will not be submitted without a borrower request. 

I already made a request to them through my original complaint to have my double payments refunded to me. I spoke to several representatives from FedLoan Servicing about this refund. Since I submitted Complaint # XXXX, numerous FedLoan Servicing employees stated that I needed to complete a Military Forbearance Request to receive my refund. I was not in forbearance during this time period because I was in active repayment and the DoD was also paying the loan on my behalf. I refuse to sign a document that says that my loans were in forbearance when they were not. This appears to be another deceptive tactic of PHEAA to prolong my repayment period and hinder my ability to qualify for PSLF. FedLoan Servicing Representatives also told me that when the company receives a DoD Lump Sum Payment, their internal policy is to apply the payment to the 12 proceeding monthsmonths that the Servicemember has already paidrather than apply the payments to the 12 following months. What this means is that FedLoan Servicing has implemented internal policies to charge twice every single U.S. Servicemember who receives a student-loan repayment benefit from the DoD who is also working towards qualifiying for PSLF. As I stated in my previous complaint, I would like my double payments to be refunded in the amount of {$4000.00}. I refuse to sign a document stating that I was in forbearance during this time period as a condition to receive this refund, because I was not in forbearance. I request that FedLoan Servicing stop manipulating federal policies and regulations designed to protect borrowers to their own financial benefit of prolonging borrower 's loan repayment. They have not only harmed me, but all Servicemembers who receive this kind benefit as part of their military service.",None,AES/PHEAA,TX,79912,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,04/30/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4338716

Later, around XXXX, when I believed that I have made at least the 10 years of payments to qualify for the debt forgiveness, I contacted them to ask what I needed to do to apply for it. They told me that I needed to apply through XXXX because I could not apply through them ( ACS ). So I contacted XXXX. XXXX said I had to consolidate my loans with them - none of the payments I had made through ACS qualified for the PSLF program. ACS had given me incorrect information. ACS should have informed me that the type of loans I had with them needed to be refinanced or consolidated into a new type in order to qualify for PSLF instead of telling to continue to make payments for many years.

SOFI does not disclose any details on loan terms until after your application is approved so I submitted an application to see what the terms would be. After SOFI approved my loan I asked for the terms and found the terms nearly userous in spite of my stellar credit and asked them to cancel my application immediately which I was assured would happen. 

Within two days hence I recieved a "" notice of disbursement '' to XXXX  XXXX and SOFI had released funds against my wishes. I called quickly and asked them to stop payment and they said "" too late '' I would need to contact XXXX XXXX to return the funds putting the entire burden on my shoulders for their mistake. 

I have subsequently spent TWO MONTHS making more than 30 phone calls and countless hours negotiating the return of the funds between XXXX XXXX, State of VA, SOFI, and XXXX. The funds dissappeared multiple times for weeks at a time in the handling process leaving me wondering if they were permanently lost or stolen. It was so easy for SOFI to release funds without my go ahead, yet nearly impossible to get them returned. 

While this was happening the loan aged to a point where it was greater than 60 days past due, my credit file has been impacted along with late fees that SOFI wants to collect. 

All in All a horrifying experience mired in loan shark mafiosos tactics that need to be cloesly monitored for this fringe operator. SOFI seems to aim for the minimum standard of compliance and and may be operating below the legal compliance threshold to keep their cost low and profitability high.

Basically, any transaction I try to complete with FedLoan takes a quarter year to complete. Yes, you read that right : a quarter year. Three months. 

Anyway, after being told that everything looked fine on their end ( but their website was acting "" glitchy '' ), I was told to wait a few days and check my employment certification again. I then received two call-backs that I missed. When attempting to call back, I was sent to three different customer service reps in rapid succession with no explanation. In the end, I found someone willing to speak to me, and they told me they'd submit some kind of request and to check again in 7-10 days. I was never able to find the original customer service representative that called me back.

7-10 days. Again.

A few days later, on XXXX I contacted Sallie Mae because I needed additional funds disbursed to the university in which I attend. I contacted Sallie Mae with the express intention of taking advantage of the additional funds offered to me on loan 1, because I only needed {$2100.00}. During this phone call, the Sallie Mae representative insisted that I was not able to increase the funds of my student loan, and coerced me into taking a second separate loan in the amount of {$2100.00}. The interest rate for loan 2 is 9.750 %. 

On XX/XX/2021 I received two email communications from Sallie Mae. These emails stated that I was approved for an additional {$5000.00} funding when I originally applied for the loan and that action was required in order to receive additional funding. 

On XXXX I contacted Sallie Mae by their online customer support chat on their website. During that conversation the Sallie Mae representative continued insisting that they call me and refused to resolve any issues in writing by email, online chat, or other methods.

I received a letter from the new lender ( under which I refinanced my loan ) on XX/XX/2020 indicating that payoffs have been sent to University Accounting Service , LLC ( UAS Connect ). Despite this, the loan servicer reported that I was 30-59 days late on my XXXX loan payment. Furthermore, the loan servicer reported that not only was a regular payment due, but that the total principal of the loan was the amount due in XXXX. This severely impacted my XXXXredit score. After noticing this on my credit score, I went to the website and noticed that the only amount the servicer would allow me to pay off was {$510.00}.

The customer service representative told me to email XXXX with my issue. To that email address I wrote the following : -- -- -- As of today I have discovered that a loan, now seemingly owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I was informed by customer service is indeed Navient, has defaulted as of XX/XX/XXXX. 
On the phone I was informed that the loan was delinquent in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I dispute this for the following reasons. I am under the income-based repayment. I have attached my IBR request that was sent. 
I've also included my last communication I received from Navient, which is about my Income Driven Repayment request. I have not received any form of communication from Navient or XXXX since that email. 
As mentioned above, there has been no communication about either any delinquency or other issues. The only way I discovered the loan was in default was through the studentaid.gov which reminded me to check on my loans in relation to the CARES act. 
The address you have on file is incorrect and has been so for many years. I have repeatedly provided more up-to-date contact information. Navient clearly does have my email address. 
Considering this, the loan should be removed from being defaulted immediately. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX -- -- - I received immediately the following confirmation email : -- -- Thanks for your recent e-mail regarding your student loan ( s ).

As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten a single response from Navient.

I spoke to a XXXX XXXX who said that he was struggling to pull up the information I sent for unclear reasons. I then sent the same email as above, under his advice, to XXXX, also now including evidence of my original email. I received no response. 
-- - On XX/XX/XXXX I called Pioneer Credit Recovery again and spoke with a manager who then advised me to email all the documentation again to XXXX and that XXXX XXXX will handle my account. I did so. He advised me to contact Navient as well and that they will forward the information to their client and see if they can get the default investigated. He claimed that their job is to close the account and if that means taking it out of default because it was a mistake then they have done their job correctly as well. He told me to call back the next day to see if there has been any progress. I called Navient immediately who told me they werent able to do anything, the loan is in default, and they have no way of assisting me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX at Pioneer Credit who claimed that their client said they could not verify my identity and therefore require more documentation to prove who I am. I sent the same email as above, with the same attachments, but now also including my passport and drivers licence scans.

This sum is in the neighborhood of the final amount they are supposed to collect over the life of a {$30000.00} loan with a repayment duration of 10 years, at 5.75 % interest rate. Not only do I question the amount to be much higher than normal, but also to stipulate whether the loan, at this point, should be paid off. Instead, if adding to remaining balance of {$17000.00}, the amount of {$13000.00} already paid, in excess, over the disbursed amount, of {$30000.00}, Navient plans to collect at least the sum of {$30000.00}, in finance charge! This is both ridiculous and absurd to charge an interest rate of 13.50 %!!, which, though variable, caps at 8 % : Here is the response I received from Navient ( I have attached the letter with my complaint ) : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- "" It is important to understand that interest accrues beginning at disbursement until the loan is paid in full.

In addition to the disbursed amount, this would total approximately {$70000.00} over the life of the loan. 
The finance charge provided on the Disclosure Statement is an estimate and can vary based on the actual interest rate charged on your loan, as the interest rate for your loan is variable. This amount may also change due to the use of deferment, forbearance, or making late or reduced payments.

Moreover, the exorbitant charge shall be interpreted as evidence of financial tort and business malpractice, on their part, instead of used to prove I agreed to repay such an abusive fee. I was financially misled by Navient, who is wrongfully overcharging an interest of 13.50 %, instead of keeping the rate within the required 4.75 to 8 % bracket. If the current repayment plan were to be maintained, when {$70000.00} is finally collected, subtracting {$44000.00}, it would result in an illicit extra surcharge of {$26000.00} ( approximated ).

I have had nothing but a run-around from Navient. And now they are ruining my credit score. 
They were not sending timely monthly statements for me to pay on my student loan. 
Apparently, they assume that all people have computers and pay their bill online. My computer crashed and I was not able to purchase a new one, and requested that a paper bill be sent to me prior to the due date so I could pay it. That never happened and still hasn't. 
Instead of Navient sending a timely monthly statement, I would receive a past due statement every 2-3 months, which would include late fees assessed. Therefore, I filed the above complaint. How can I pay timely when I don't receive a timely statement? And especially when I specifically requested those timely statements to pay by? 

On XX/XX/2020, in response to my complaint, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX, Office of the Customer Advocate.

She was incorrect in saying that because I was NOT receiving timely monthly statements to pay by. Therefore, I phoned her back at the phone # she provided 6 times, and left a voice mail for her to return my call each time. Nobody ever returned my call.

Currently, Navient is reporting to the Credit Bureaus that I am not paying my loan, even though they are not complying with our agreement, and what they promised to do. 

How can I pay them timely if they are not sending me timely statements? I can not. They have a scam going which ruins credit scores, and makes them extra money by assessment of late fees.

I took out the original loans in XXXX with DOE via XXXX, 6 loans for a total of $ XXXX. Before I even graduated those loans were sold 2x and again 2x after I graduated. This meant my interest was capitalized ( and my principal balance mushroomed ) before I was even in repayment. I fully paid off 2 of the 6 loans right away, though it appears XXXX illegally kept those loans open with {$1.00} and {$37.00} balances. XXXX I was duped into consolidating onto the PAYE play with a fraudulent and now defunct company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Despite paying since XXXX, and paying well all the real principal, I still owe 120 % of what I borrowed to to shady practices of servicers like this XXXX. 

I want them to do the right thing and apply the extra payments I have made from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to my principal balance. Should they fail to do so, I will have no choice but to pursue any and all legal avenues open to me.

This year is the same. When I filed for XXXX and the servicer doubled my payments. I can not afford the higher amount and this will force me into default. I see the Department of Education has finally addressed FFEL loans like mine, but only for those in default. It is my hope that the Department of Education will do better than this. No one who holds a FFEL wanted to have this type of loan, and like me no one knew they were getting one. It was the discretion of the Department of Education to put loans like mine that were refinanced through them into either a FFEL or a DL. I would be halfway to PSLF if I had a DL, and I certainly thought I had one until recently. At age XXXX it is not realistic for me to start over on PSLF with a new DL, and I shouldnt have to.

Re : Navient Student Loan Servicer. 

Please let this serve as a formal complaint of Navient due to the following circumstances. I initially applied for and received a student loan in XXXX to attend school from XXXX to XXXX. I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. Payments were initiated sometime in XXXX. Of major concern, the loan amount being reported by Navient could not possibly be correct. This is based on known payments made and records that I have. Payments were made up until I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy due to financial hardship in XX/XX/XXXX. I have since then completed my payment plan in XX/XX/XXXX. 

From communication with Navient in XX/XX/XXXX, I was given a balance of approximately {$74000.00}. It was acknowledged that they had received approximately {$17000.00} from Chapter XXXX trustee. However, I was told it had gone to interest payments. I inquired about payments made to loan prior to filing bankruptcy. I was told that, the loan had been consolidated in XXXX and the balance was {$65000.00} and that Interest of {$8500.00} was added bringing the balance to approximately {$74000.00}. I inquired about payments made prior to consolidating loan. I was informed no records were available because it was someone else handling the loan at that time. 

From communication with XXXX at Navient on XX/XX/XXXX, it was acknowledged that {$20.00}, XXXX had been receive from the Chapter XXXX trustee. However, balance was still listed as approx. {$74000.00}. The additional {$3000.00} had not been credited to decrease balance. 

After addressing my concerns, I received a response from XXXX XXXX at Navient. Transaction record was sent and a formula attempting to explain the extraordinarily high interest rate. However, none of these numbers listed a balance of {$74000.00} or gave any justification of this balance. 


Before deciding on additional actions, I must demand the following from Navient : 1. Record of all payments received. 
2. Full disclosure of total amount of interest charged. 

Other information may be requested based on information received. 

PS : I have a statement from XX/XX/XXXX, showing a balance of approximately {$43000.00}. Several payments have been made over the last 10 years.

04/06/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Navient Account # XXXX I started with loans of around {$18000.00} and was garnished for 12 years, I now owe around {$30000.00}. 

I graduated in XXXX. I paid some payments through the years but finally defaulted after some financial difficulties. In XXXX, XXXX XXXX  ( I think ) contacted me about rehabilitating my loan. They said if I paid {$150.00} per month for a year then my credit would be cleared and I could just keeping making payments. Nothing was ever mentioned about higher payments in the future. 

After the year of full payments on time, they said I had to make {$400.00} a month payments. I said I couldn't, so they said they would garnish my wages. I let that go through since at the time they could only garnish 10 %, which was less than the {$400.00} a month. I figured they would just take it out of my paycheck & it would be paid off. They never mentioned that they were required to negotiate a monthly amount with me, as I have since found they were required to. They said pay the {$400.00} or be garnished. 

Later the garnishment went up to 15 % due to a change in Florida law. I was garnished for 12 years. When I called to get a status after the 12 years, they said I still owed about {$30000.00} ( the original loan was {$18000.00} ). When I tried to contact the servicer at that time, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I think run under XXXX XXXX, their website was gone & the phone number directed me to Sallie Mae, who had no information on any outstanding loans. I checked with my employer & got the name of the collection agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted them & now they said I owe about {$40000.00}! If I'm making payments, then how could my balance have gone up in 1 year.? They sent me paperwork & pushed me to reconsolidate. All of this is not 100 % since Im going from memory and I have been confused between who holds the loan and who services the loan, and then it gets sold so Im confused again. 

I have included Navients documentation of my loan payments. I also printed the payment history from XXXX XXXX website. It shows I have paid {$92000.00} on what was originally an $ XXXX loan! 

In addition, Navient said back then that they had no record of payments from me except for the garnishment payments. I found the history of my payments on I think the XXXX XXXX  or Sallie Mae site & sent it to them. 

I submitted a complaint to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Navient denied to the CFPB that I had made any payments other than the garnishments, but you can see from both their list and the XXXX XXXX list that I have. I told the CFPB that Navient was wrong or lying, and the next thing I know, they cancelled my garnishment. I thought maybe they had agreed that I had more than paid for this loan, but apparently they just sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX since it had become a problem account. 

I asked for a hearing, as was my right. I never got one. Most of the above information I sent to the hearing officer. One the date & time of my hearing appointment, no one called. I called Navient & they said the officer suspended my payments & there would be no hearing. This went for a couple of years. Now every year or so I get another letter from another collector. I send them the information preceding this, including the CFPB complaint, and ask for a hearing. I get nothing. They are not garnishing my wages right now, but they are still taking my tax refunds. I recently heard again from XXXX again & sent them the previous information & asked for a hearing. Instead of a hearing, I received a history of my payments & a letter from Navient mostly talking about my credit report. I don't know if they are seeking garnishment again. 

I am so confused & don't understand how I can pay so much & have my balance go up. I don't even understand the relationship between all the parties involved. I am XXXX years old & coming up on retirement & can't afford to pay {$400.00} a month again, especially if the principal goes up instead of down. That's insane. I feel that since I have paid more than 4 times what I owed, even with penalties and interest, that this loan should be considered paid off.

04/22/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"I am writing to complain about Navients educational loan unfair tactics used to keep their payees in perpetual debt. I understand there is a class action complaint in process. I would like to learn what I can do about my situation and be included in the class action process as well. 

Some background, in XXXX, my two education loans were consolidated under Sallie Mae at a six percent interest rate and eventually managed by Navient. The original principle amount was ( {$51000.00} ). Over the past twenty years, payments were made totaling {$63000.00}. As of today, XXXX XXXX, my balance is {$40000.00}. Meaning, after making over 160 monthly payments over the past sixteen years of {$63000.00}, the principle on my loans has only reduced by {$10000.00}. Ridiculous!! 

Part of the reasoning that the principle does not decrease very much is most of the monthly payment goes towards the interest. Also, additional interest has been capitalized on top of the balance due to a few periods of time when loan was on deferment or forbearance. There were times I simply did not earn enough money to pay rent, bills, and student loan payments and I fell into a vicious cycle. Sallie Mae or Navient never gave me an option that worked with my income/debt ratio that was realistic. I had to go bankrupt in XXXX due to having too much debt and not enough income. That only resulted in credit card debt being excused, not education loans. 

Over the past few years I have been able to make inflated payments due to increased income. Only then was I able to reduce the principle a little. My efforts should have gone further than a few thousand dollars towards principle. The interest structure on these loans is what is preventing the borrowers from getting to payoff. 

Currently, I am unemployed and afraid of not being able to keep up with the momentum of payoff. I fear that will result in more interest being capitalized and the balance increasing again. 

As it stands today, I will need to make a monthly payment of at least {$460.00} until I am XXXX years old. So, I will have to hold off on retirement or win the lottery or something to get this debt off my back. It wouldnt be so bad if my payments went towards the principle. I honestly think the finance companies should not make the huge profits off of educational loan debt that our system allows for them to. 

I am anxiously waiting to see what President Biden and Congress will pass for our indebted education loan borrowers in perpetual payback, if anything. So far nothing in the works seems to pertain to my situation. 

I am asking for guidance from the CFPB. Can you guide me towards a resolution or direct me towards the current efforts that may improve my situation. Anything would be appreciated.

The XXXX XXXX XXXX has tried to help but can only do so much in this situation. I need help and I need it fast before this loan company charges me any more money when I have already sent them my loan payoff check. I am copying and pasting both complaints in full. I apologize for how much is here, but Im trying to give as many details as possible in order to get this situation resolved. 

Complaint # 1 : Submitted XX/XX/2021 I currently have a school loan with Utah Higher Education XXXX which I am attempting to pay off after the sale of my home. They have been consistently difficult to work with throughout the years and I am thankful to finally be able to take the proceeds from the sale of my home and pay off the full amount. 
Unfortunately, UHEAA has always been very difficult to work with and is carrying on the same pattern of fraudulent activities as it always has. 
I have heard and read of many complaints against school loan companies over the years and thought it is simply a result of people who are complaining solely because they are unhappy with their debt. However, as I have been attempting to work with UHEAA over the past few years and, even as I attempt to pay off my loan currently, I am beginning to realize that all the complaints at least against this company are true. 
I imagine how many other young professionals are going through the same horror story as my own without knowing how to find freedom from this company and its domineering practices. I hope my complaint will be able to help others in the future. 
Years ago, my school loan ( initially a XXXX XXXX loan, who was under Federal investigation ) was sold to UHEAA without my knowledge. At this time they began to harass me with phone calls from multiple unlisted numbers regarding paying my school loan. Not knowing that this company now owned my school loans, I ignored the phone calls. Once I found out through a mailing ( which UHEAA no longer does ), I was able to set up payments with this company. Unfortunately, my credit score had already dropped because my account had been listed as delinquent during this time of transition even though I was unaware of the circumstances until it was too late. 
Despite that, UHEAA has always followed a consistent fraudulent pattern when managing my account. After researching reviews of this company, I see now they do the same pattern to everybody. 
When requesting a hard times forbearance, or changing the payment plan, UHEAA initially requests that I fill out paperwork and fax it to them. When I call the same day to verify that the paperwork was received, they acknowledge the receipt of paperwork and state that it will take up to 5 business days to process the information. Typically, after submitting the paperwork, I would receive a notice about 7-10 days later stating my account was delinquent. 
When I would call UHEAA to find out what was going on, they would say the paperwork was never received. When told that I had confirmation that the paperwork was received, UHEAA would then check and confirm that they truly had received the paperwork even though they originally said they had not. This was usually followed by a statement placing the blame on me, stating I had not filled out a form that was necessary or that my paperwork did not have the necessary information. This pattern would go on every week or two for at least 6 weeks with me calling and going through the whole process multiple times until UHEAA finally processed the paperwork on their end. 
I recently sold my home and am using some of the proceeds to do a full payoff of my UHEAA school loan. 
This time, when it came time to pay the loan off, I requested my Title broker assist me by taking the payoff of the house and completing the process for me. I hoped they would be more professional with my broker and I wouldnt have to fight with UHEAA anymore. 
My loan had been in forbearance due to COVID financial difficulties and my first payment was due on XX/XX/2021 after my forbearance was up. The broker called before the XXXX to attempt to pay off my loan using the proceeds of my home sale. She completed all the paperwork and was told by UHEAA that it would take 5 business days to process. UHEAA informed my broker that they would contact her within 5 business days to complete the loan payoff. 
I called my broker last Friday, the XXXX of XXXX to see if she had heard from UHEAA. Knowing UHEAAs reputation for never returning phone calls, I encouraged my broker to call them and follow up when she stated that she had not yet heard from them. She was unable to reach them until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the meantime, I received an email from UHEAA stating my account was past due and delinquent, despite the fact that the payoff paperwork had already been submitted for nearly 2 weeks. When I informed my broker of this, she immediately called UHEAA. They informed her that they refused to process the previous paperwork she had submitted because I had not signed an authorization for release form for UHEAA to discuss my accounts with my broker. 
By this time, my broker had carried out at least 3 phone conversations with UHEAA regarding my account and the paperwork necessary to complete the payoff for me. Why did UHEAA never even bother to inform my broker about the need for the release forms on any of the previous phone calls? 
Being disgusted with UHEAAs practices, I called UHEAA myself after leaving my brokers office and signing the release form. I informed UHEAA that if this payoff was not completed within 2 weeks I would be reporting UHEAA as well as seeking legal counsel against them. Today, in response to my phone call stating I would be reporting their fraudulent practices, UHEAA sent me a notice stating that my account was delinquent and no longer in good standing. 
UHEAA consistently follows the same pattern of behavior of not processing billing and payoff requests until at least 4-6 weeks unless we, the consumers, call frequently to check up on them. UHEAA further delays the process nearly every time by saying the wrong paperwork was submitted or inadequate paperwork was submitted when it is the representatives at UHEAA who tell us which paperwork to submit. If we are submitting what UHEAA tells us to submit, how can it always be the wrong paperwork? 
It is a ploy to lay the blame back on the consumer so UHEAA looks like they are in better standing than they are. 
UHEAA also states that information submitted on paperwork ( Ie : check stubs, employer forms ) does not have accurate or necessary information for UHEAA to accurately process the paperwork when all the information truly is right where it needs to be on the paperwork. 
In the meantime, UHEAA is able to drag the process on for weeks and even months, continuing to accrue interest instead of allowing a loan to be paid off or to accrue late fees instead of allowing a loan to be placed in good standing. It is a fraudulent practice to draw the process out to make more money and then blame it on the consumer when the consumer has, in fact, done everything UHEAA has requested. 
Please, please help me! All I want is to get this school loan paid off forever. But at this rate the interest continues to accrue and UHEAA starts the process of assessing late fees when none of my paperwork was late. Please help me! I just want to be free of this company forever! 


Complaint # 2 : Submitted XX/XX/2021 I recently filed a complaint over the way UHEAA is handling my attempts to pay off my school loan with them. They use fraudulent and underhanded business practices to prolong any process of the customer taken to pay UHEAA in order to accrue further interest and sometimes even incur late fees where a late fee is unwarranted. 
I recently sold my home in the end of XXXX and my title attorney and myself have been attempting to pay off my school loans serviced through UHEAA. UHEAA continues to prolong the process by refusing to return phone calls, omitting essential information necessary to complete the process, or misdirecting any requests and questions by myself or my title attorney. 
Upon further review of other complaints against this company, it is clear that UHEAA does this to many of its customers. I am beginning to believe this is a fraudulent practice enacted intentionally on the part of UHEAA in order to gain more money from their customers. If UHEAA charges {$10.00} a day in interest to 1000 customers attempting to pay off their loans and UHEAA prolongs the payoff process for 30 days, UHEAA stands to make {$300000.00} extra off of these customers above what the customers originally intended to pay. This is a very lucrative means of increasing the amount of money that UHEAA makes on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. It is even more lucrative if you consider late fees that UHEAA might stand to accrue if they prolong the process even further than 30 days, say 60 or 90 days ... Especially if UHEAA can effectively make it look like all the delay is the customers fault by stating the customer did not present the necessary documentation, that the paperwork was filled out inaccurately, or by omitting necessary information that the customer needs in order to carry out UHEAAs appropriate protocol. 
UHEAA may allege that no illegal activity is occurring here by laying all the blame back on the customer, but UHEAA is indeed carrying out illegal activity by refusing to give accurate information necessary to the customer in order to carry out appropriate payment. 
I state all this in response to UHEAAs response to my previous complaint. After filing my complaint, I received a very prompt return phone call from UHEAA the next day. However, the delay tactics continue even now weeks later. First, UHEAA attempted to lay the blame back on me for payoff problems by stating I and my title attorney filled out the wrong paperwork. Of course, UHEAA never told myself or my attorney about the form required during the multiple phone calls regarding what documentation was necessary in order to finalize loan payoff. Once we learned of the necessary paperwork, it was filled out and returned to UHEAA within 24 hours. Another phone call to UHEAA revealed that UHEAA was now stating we filled the paperwork out wrong. As a result, the paperwork was filled out accurately and returned to UHEAA that same day. My title attorney and I didnt hear anything from UHEAA at all after resubmitting the paperwork. I provided my attorney with a number for the embezzlement department that UHEAA gave me after filing my previous complaint. When she attempted to call more than 3 times, she did not even receive a dial tone on the other end of the line. Not until I called the embezzlement department and told them to call my title attorney, was she able to reach or speak with anybody from that department. 
The embezzlement office provided my title attorney with an address to send in the payoff amount. My title attorney sent it that day via XXXX next day mail and we received confirmation that the package was received. Four days later, I am still receiving emails from UHEAA stating that my account is past due and in delinquent status even though we started this payoff process before my original payment date. Five days after the package was documented as having been delivered, I called the embezzlement office to determine if they had seen the package with my payoff check yet. I was told by the UHEAA employee that my title attorney had been given an inaccurate address by the UHEAA employee and that the mail had not been delivered to the correct address. The mail was, however, being forwarded to the correct address but the employee was unable to tell me how long it would take for the package to arrive. 
When I complained about UHEAA stating that my account is delinquent when it is, in fact, in payoff status, the employee told me that I was supposed to continue making monthly payments to UHEAA until the payoff checked is received. 
I refuse to make any more payments to UHEAA. The check to pay this account off was sent and received over 5 days ago. It is not my fault it went to the wrong address but UHEAAs fault. I will not be penalized any longer for UHEAAs fraudulent activity. If UHEAA has the gall to attempt this one one customer, how many other customers are they taking the exact same actions against? How much extra money is UHEAA making off of prolonging their customers valid and earnest attempts to pay their school loans in a manner that is ethical. UHEAA continues to carry out their unethical practices even while under review from the XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as other reporting agencies.",None,Utah System of Higher Education,ME,04210,None,Consent provided,Web,03/08/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4144998

Im sorely disgruntled. And I am going to fight back. Finally. 

I tried the XXXX XXXX, but there werent enough characters to explain my circumstances. I was denied. 

What happened. XXXX I was admitted into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  based on my XXXX  in XXXX, XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I am smart. 

However, to achieve XXXX 's XXXX XXXX  degree, I discovered that a XXXX  in XXXX  was required. I flunked out of the program. With a student loan hanging over my head.

I had never heard of a thesis statement and was never exposed to how to write a paper based on that. 

At XXXX, I wrote technical documents, taught technical classes, and went to technical conferences. 

In fact, I worked so hard at flunking at XXXX, that sitting in front of my computer for hours caused XXXX. As an IL XXXX XXXX XXXX and falling off a pole working my way to school in the XXXX, I had hairline fractures in my XXXX. Sitting and reading English Literature to catch up, caused extreme health issues. I eventually had to get XXXX in my back to alleviate the pain. I cant sit for long periods of time. 

I tried my best to get a XXXX in XXXX  at the same time I got an XXXX  in XXXX, but found that it was totally impossible. Im not a quitter.

I feel so defrauded. 

Had the admissions counselor inquired about my reading habits, she would have found that I lacked the background in English Literature to succeed. 

My reading habits when I was admitted to your program : Any XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX short stories History memoirs ( XXXX, Civil War ) I do living history events. 
Cookbooks ( I have XXXX XXXX Any XXXX XXXX Cooking, preserving, drying Gardening Prepping Writing, memoirs, how-to IT technical manuals XXXX Texas training. I was a paid tour guide. 

I have read XXXX XXXX XXXX Shrugged and XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, In XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX back in High School, XXXX. Thats it. At home I read XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

In the middle XXXX, I was an installer/repairman and barely had time to eat, sleep, and shower. The job was very strenuous, but It helped pay for college. 

I graduated from college in XXXX, and worked at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX for 23 years. After early retirement, I hoped for a career in Creative Writing. XXXX  at that time, XXXX, was the only college I could find. 

UNFORTUNATELY for me, a career did not pan out. 

So, because I have been duped, I am filing a complaint with XXXX, FTC, XXXX, Nelnet, XXXX XXXX and sending to my Texas Senators as well as New Hampshire Senators. 

I failed because XXXX failed me. I can see how the college just loves its online customers and we see ads of those that passed, but dont hear how you have misrepresented the college of those that failed. 

I do not pay for fraudulent misrepresentation. Ever.

I am being charged late fees with no explanation as to the time frame these fee were accrued. I paid XX/XX/2021 late fees as I did not want to accrue penalties, fines or risk a negative credit impact. 
I have received two email responses to this topic but have not been given answers that are detailed or specific to the issue. 
Here is the latest example of what I have received : Please note that XXXX billing statement shows another late fee, although I paid this last month. It seems to be an "" on going '' late fee, irrelevant of whether it is paid or not. 
Thank you for any assistance with this problem. 

Navient Response : Thank you for reaching out to us regarding late fees. I am happy to assist you. 
A late fee is assessed on the XXXX day of delinquency. Commonly, the fee amount is 6 % of the monthly payment amount. 
The late fees will show as due until they are paid in full. 
You do not need to pay these fees at this time. 
Payments are applied to your account as follows : 1. ) Unpaid Fees ( if applicable ).

2. ) Unpaid Accrued Interest.

3. ) Unpaid Principal. 
If you have a FFELP loan in an Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) plan, the payment goes first to Unpaid Interest, then to Unpaid Fees, and then to Unpaid Principal. 
The formula we use to calculate daily accruing interest is : ( Unpaid Principal ) x ( Interest Rate ) x ( Number of Days Accrued ) = ( Y ) ( Y ) Number of Days in the Year = Accrued Interest Best Regards, XXXX, Loan Servicing Specialist ref : XXXX : ref Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX XXXX XXXX",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WA,98591,None,Consent provided,Web,02/04/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4115471

In order to make these payments towards principle, you have to write a check and mail it to Navient, and include a note that specifies that this payment must be made toward principal and include account number. You have to find the address, which is different depending on the type of loan you wish to repay. 

Additionally, Navient offers settings online that determine where any overpayment might be sent. None of these options give the choice of paying towards principal. 

In order for anyone to pay off a loan within a reasonable amount of time, it is advised to make additional payments towards principal.

I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with help from a friend, XXXX XXXX - we spoke with XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX about why that loan was in repayment. We were told that when we filled out the loan paperwork at Citizens Bank - a box was checked stating I wanted to make payments right away on XXXX 's loan and a box was checked to defer on XXXX 's loan. Also XXXX XXXX stated that email communication was checked on the application therefore all payment notices were sent to student 's email even if the loan was co-signed for.

This was new information to me. XXXX is a XXXX XXXX XXXX beginning a 4 year program. She was in school full time from XX/XX/XXXX and is enrolled full time for the spring semester XXXX. 
We called back again to XXXX XXXX and spoke with a XXXX.

The website is filled with information related to COVID-19, needing help with student loans, etc. The website states that during a COVID-19 forbearance interest is not capitalized.

The website discourages borrowers from telephoning and encourages borrowers to apply for forbearance via its website. I used the website to apply for a forbearance for a COVID related income reduction. This was good for 90 days. I utilized the same process in XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that my Economic Hardship application was denied and I would have a {$750.00} payment due that month. I could not pay that amount because my net income is $ XXXXmonth. I called again and was told I should apply for the Income Driven Repayment Plan, which I did the same day. I was also told I would get another 90 day forbearance because I said my repayment problems were still related to COVID. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that Nelnet did not give me a COVID forbearance that would not capitalize interest and instead gave me a "" general forbearance '' whereby accrued interest would be capitalized into the principal. 

I feel like Nelnet engaged in a "" bait and switch '' as to the forbearance. During my call on XX/XX/XXXX with Nelnet, I learned it was not possible to obtain a COVID forbearance via their website and that anyone with my type of student loans ( Federal Direct that were consolidated ) had to call Nelnet to obtain the COVID forbearance. This was incredibly misleading and I believe that this is an illegal "" bait and switch ''. 

To a lesser extent, I am also complaining the IBR program was not fully explained and I believe I was pressured into it because Nelnet did not want to give me another COVID forbearance despite the fact I had to remind the Nelnet rep I knew that the COVID forbearance was extended to XX/XX/XXXX.

03/24/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I took out private loans with Sallie Mae is the summer of XXXX in order to begin school at XXXX University. After having successfully graduated with a XXXX GPA and collecting many athletic awards, I began to make my payments six months after graduation in XXXX of XXXX. I have been making on time payments for twelve consecutive months as directed in order to release my cosigner in hopes of adjusting my monthly payments at the end of this tedious process. I submitted my Cosigner Release Form the XXXX of XXXX in XXXX. After submitting this document, I was told by company representatives that the approval process could take up to 30 days, although it typically only takes 10 days. My next payment came due half way through the following month. I inquired about my release form before submitted my payment and was told that in order for them to continue processing my release form, I would need to make the payment. I was slightly frustrated but complained and, once again, submit my payment on time. I called several times through the month of XXXX to see if my document had been approved because this company does not reach out unless they are reminding you of the payment they want from you. In XXXX, I was told once again that I had to pay my monthly bill in order to move forward. This payment has been a monthly amount of over {$1000.00} which I have been working over XXXX hours a week to uphold. After the XXXX payment, I quit paying because I felt I was stuck in a revolving door. This company has called both me and my cosigner numerous times a day in regards to collecting thousands of dollars. After speaking with collection agents for hours on end, they have no interest in customer service. I was told they had to have my account caught up entirely to be able to speak with another department or that they could defer my loans. The catch is that I can not say both me and my cosigner can not pay the bill because they will defer it and surely destroy my credit. There is no type of COVID-19 relief or forgiveness offered from this company either. I explained that releasing my cosigner was my top priority and that a deferment would make it impossible for them to release the individual. This representative could only present me with two options. Both of those options were oriented to getting their money at that very moment and, consequently, trapping my cosigner and I in an endless loop of financial abuse. 

The past four months have been a flurry of endless phone calls, emails, and letters sent to both me and my cosigner. This business has repeatedly tried to trap me in a situation of never ending payments that are beyond what I should be paying at this point. They are doing their absolute best to trap both my co-signer and I. When I voice these issues, I am giving the generic resolutions that I could, and have, simply found on the internet. There is seemingly no understanding or recognition of the economic repercussions of COVID-19 as they are trying to portray they repayment options they had in place years ago as COVID-19 relief. These forms of relief are a few options they sent me in the mail are the same ones they told me over the phone : simply paying even more for three months, deferring your loans, or paying as much as one can in the next few months. All of these trap both you and your co-signer. I paid my debt for 12 full months and was told 3 months after filing my my co-signer release form that I was supposedly late on a payment in XXXX. I have had numerous phone calls with different representatives in that XXXX month period and that was the first time I was notified of any late payment. Now they expect me to pay over a grand each month for yet another year. I feel the business has a complete disregard to COVID-19, their customers, as well as their own employees who have taken out loans with them. My case worker, XXXX XXXX, continuously presents me with the same options rather than understanding the mistakes on the part of this lender. The fact that an employee who was taking my case for a week in XXXX said to me that she regrets taking a loan out with this company speaks worlds of their character and what they truly value. It is also clear through the endless pages of complaints on this company.

The counselor then told us that there was a program that would qualify me for an independent loan. The counselor then proceeded to say I could apply for this loan only if I was denied the initial loan. The loan she spoke of however asked for a co-signer of which to re-apply however, my mother was unwilling to co-sign for a loan, and clearly and boldly stated that this was something she did not and couldn't do because of her own situation. The counselor assured us based on my mothers information that we would be denied the initial loan in order to qualify for the second loan due to us not meeting the household income requirements. We trusted the counselors advice and went forward with the original application with my mother as a co-signer with the understanding that we would be denied the initial loan in order for me to be independently qualified for the alternative loan. The initial loan was denied which caused me to qualify for the alternative loan. 

When I completed an XXXX XXXX program I began to receive letters in the mail stating that my mother and I had a private loan at a 12.5 % interest rate. I was confused because I didnt recall being approved for a loan with my mother as a co-signer, nor did I believe that I applied for a loan at a rate of 12.5 %. After several attempts throughout the years of trying to contact Sallie Mae at the time ( now Navient debt collectors ) and no one could provide me with information on the loan but kept insisting that I make a payment. Since no one could provide me with information, I refused to pay the loan. As a result, I began receiving harassing phone calls from debt collectors ; they even began to contact my mother and threaten to sue her if she failed to make a payment. Because of fear and intimidation, my mother made a payment thinking it would stop the abusive tactics from debt collectors. I eventually was able to reach upper management of Sallie Mae and they informed me that the original loan with my mother as a co-signer was initially denied but then months later it was approved. This was all without my knowledge. Sallie Mae claimed that because it was used by the school that the money is still owed, regardless of me being informed. When I expressed my grievances they refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and insisted that I pay. I did some research on the school and its name has changed to XXXX XXXX.

I have worked for a qualifying employer for nearing 10 years, since XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, with a qualifying payment plan. 

When my loans were transferred to FedLoanServicing for PSLF, I noticed over a year 's worth of payments to one of my previous, now defunct, servicers, "" Direct Loan Servicing '' were not being counted toward PSLF or TEPSLF despite being over a year 's worth of payments made under the standard repayment plan while working for a qualifying employer. This period is being classified as "" No bill '' - except I certainly had bills during this time, because I still have the receipts! 

In XXXX of XXXX I submitted over a year 's worth of receipts to FedLoanServicing so these payments, and a few others, could be manually tabulated. If tabulated correctly, I should qualify for TEPSLF in XXXX of XXXX. I have been waiting 10 months for them to do this.

They scheduled a review of my account for the months from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX when this review should be from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. They are also listing any time my loans were transferred to other servicers as months that do not qualify, despite being instructed by these servicers to continue making payments as usual until the transfer was complete. I have two months until I *should* be at 120 qualifying payments ( I was hired by a qualifying employer on XX/XX/XXXX and continue to work there ).

I remember being in forbearance for a year or two but then decided to start paying my loans because I wanted to build my credit and get rid of those loans as soon as possible. I had multiple discussions and arguments with Salliemae because they were never willing to work with me on a payment plan. During XXXX, someone I spoke to quoted me a $ XXXX/monthly dollar payment which was absurd giving my salary and expenses ( which I provided to salliemae ). Weeks later, sallie mae sent all my accounts to collections and that impacted my credit score negatively. My credit score literally went from the 700 hundreds to the 500 hundreds. Weeks later, I was having a conversation with another individual at Sallie mae and she noticed that whoever worked on my financial statement missed some expenses and made a mistake on my income which explains why I was quoted a {$2000.00} monthly payment. Now, in order for me to not have a deliquent status and my step dad who is the cosigner on the loan and has retired, i decided to agreed on the monthly payment of {$850.00} a month. Multiple times I have called sallie mae to try to reduced my payment because right now giving the financial situations everyone is going thru, I can not afford to spend almost {$1000.00} in students loans. I do want to pay my loans but they are not working with me to lower my payments. I still live with my parents and I'm honestly having family issues which would require me to move. My options are going to be to either pick up a mortgage or throw money out the window paying rent and forget about paying my students loans for now but I do not want to do that which is why I decided to reach out to you guys.

NAVIENT IS NOT LISTENING TO A WORD IVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL THEM. 

In XXXX their representative made changes to my account. 

1. I phoned in asking for help!!!!!!

03/05/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"As a student beginning college in XXXX, I was approved for a student line of credit through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a co-borrower. The loan servicer for the account is University Accounting Services, LLC ( XXXX XXXX XXXX 

At the end of XX/XX/XXXX, two statements were posted one of which had the correct billing date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and {$0.00} due with the cycle ending XX/XX/XXXX, while the other had a cycle ending XX/XX/XXXX ( total interest charged for 8 days despite the cycle length being 31 ) and a billing date of XX/XX/XXXX and {$690.00} due. My co-borrower called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and talked with the loan servicer on the phone. XXXX XXXX confirmed that the statement with the cycle ending XX/XX/XXXX was sent in error. My co-borrower also asked that the loan disclosure documents be made accessible on my account and was told they would be there in 3-5 business days. The only documents to become available online after 5 days were my past statements. To this day there are still no loan disclosure documents on my account. 

I became extremely concerned when my statement due to arrive in XX/XX/XXXX was not posted until XX/XX/XXXX and noticed the information on this statement was based on the error statement. After discussing with my mom, who works for a credit union, we were under the assumption that the error statement would have been removed and the new previous balance listed on the statement for XX/XX/XXXX would be the balance of {$100000.00}, which was listed as the new balance from the XX/XX/XXXX statement ( the one that was deemed to be correct by the loan servicer ). However, the balance listed is {$100000.00} that was stated on the error statement. I also noticed that the due date for payments had suddenly changed to the date of the 18th of the month and not the 10th. Since the statements are off, I am not sure if I am being over-charged in interest as that is what it looks like. 

After seeing the statement posted XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately sent a secure message through their website, which is their suggestion, informing them of my issues and requesting a full account audit from loan inception through the current statement period. I gave them 30 days and have not heard or seen anything. I also do not have a statement for XX/XX/XXXX ; not sure if that is considered an issue especially when my next payment would be around XX/XX/XXXX, but I currently have no idea how much I would owe. I realize it would be XXXX since I am in deferment, but if that was not the case I would be cutting it really close. I would also like to point out that when calling in to their number and giving my SSN and DOB to confirm my account, they are unable to recognize that I have an account. So, I am concerned. And being a recent graduate, I was not fully expecting to be dealing with something like this, which has caused an increase in my anxiety.

Based on the landmark legal precedent set in a similar case against Wells Fargo by illegal aliens who were also denied credit on the basis of citizenship and national origin, Wells Fargo admitted that its lending policies were a violation of state and federal civil rights laws. 

Therefore, given the auspices in which Wells Fargo operated at the time of my student loan application, the terms of my private student loan were made under the same violation of federal and state laws. Wells Fargo created a situation whereby a US citizen co-signer was involved in a loan that was in violation of existing laws at the time these events occurred in my procurement of a private student loan.

02/10/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"In Wells Fargo 's response to complaints XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX } dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo instructs me to provide them with documentation of "" attendance '' of my internship activity. I supplied such documents as attachments to to complaint XXXX. Specifically, I supplied : 1 ) the image of myself with identification as an intern on the fellowship page, 2 ) W2 for XXXX listing the total sums earned over the summer internship for XXXX. Wells Fargo 's response to XXXX was : "" We have reviewed the documents you shared with regard to your internship forbearance request and regret to inform you that these documents are not sufficient to review your student loan account for an Internship/Residency or Fellowship forbearance. "" Wells Fargo provided no guidance on what type of documentation they would require to process and review such a request and what per their policy constitutes "" attendance at an internship activity. '' Wells Fargo willfully fails to understand that interns at a government facility are subject to the same rules governing the handling of UNCLASSIFIED/FOUO documents that may identify me with the internship. This applies to papers and emails I may generate, including communications between my internship supervisor, etc. Those practices help keep all of us safe. 

I would like to point out that if Wells Fargo allows internship forbearance requests over the phone, and if those requests follow the same format for in-school forbearance, then no documentation of the internship forbearance would have been required at the time of my internship and my information would be recorded. It is only now that Wells Fargo failed to make me aware that I was eligible for an internship forbearance that I am now subject to extra scrutiny. 

Given the backdrop of the current XXXX pandemic, and Wells Fargo 's announcement of their intent to sell their student loan portfolio, no less during a time of economic despair for many, it seems likely that the consistent denials and stalling by Wells Fargo are tactics being employed to force my student loan into repayment so that their student loan portfolio looks that much better for ANY potential buyer of that portfolio. 

Now, I am attaching additional documentation proving that I was an intern at a government facility for both XXXX and XXXX. It shows that I was contractually obligated to conduct internship activities as a part of my fellowship program. Mainly, I am attaching the executed agreement between myself and my academic institution that indicates my agreement to participate in internship activities as a condition of my fellowship. Secondly, I am attaching two ( 2 ) pay-stubs from the first few weeks of my internship. Third, I am attaching a Letter of Intent from the DIRECTOR OF THE FACILITY that states specifically I was an intern for the summer of XXXX and that the facility intended to have me back for XXXX as an intern. Finally, I will reattach the W2, and the offer letters. 

None of this behavior is new and a timeline of Wells Fargo 's behavior/ attempts to stall, fight, ignore forbearance request since XXXX of XXXX is hereafter. Furthermore, they have already admitted to furnishing inaccurate/incorrect information regarding my student loans to the credit reporting agencies. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX XXXX responded to complaint XXXX. Wells Fargo 's XXXX XX/XX/XXXX interim response was "" Wells Fargo needs additional time to research and respond to our customer '' In Ms. XXXX XXXX 's response she states : "" Please see the attached Bank response, '' and attaches a XXXX XX/XX/XXXX response. To clarify my complaint ( not concern ) against Wells Fargo is because they have refused to give me forbearance options I was entitled to per their policies. That is for the periods of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX, and the periods XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX I was an intern at a government research lab. Wells Fargo has a specific deferment program for internships. If Wells Fargo offers forbearance for internships, then equal protection requires them to offer that forbearance option as well -- they did not. The denial matters because Wells Fargo EFS subsequently denied my request for an in-school forbearance for periods XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX claiming that maximum in-school forbearance had been used. However, had Wells Fargo placed me in the internship forbearance, then the maximum amount of in-school forbearance time as granted XX/XX/XXXX would not have been exhausted, even if a manual review was conducted. Six ( 6 ) months of forbearance time would have been freed up from in-school forbearance and I would thus have been able to obtain an in-school forbearance thru XX/XX/XXXX. Combined with the forbearance offered commensurate with the CARES Act, I would have been able to push the payments out until XX/XX/XXXX, which was my initial request in XX/XX/XXXX that WF denied. The scheme here is quite obvious. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX published an article quotes Wells Fargos website as stating beginning on XX/XX/XXXX, only customers with an outstanding balance on a Wells Fargo Private Student Loan are eligible to be borrowers on a new private student loan for the XXXX academic year. In the article XXXX XXXX, a spokesperson for Wells Fargo is quoted as saying Wells Fargo has decided to narrow its student-lending focus. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX published an article stating that Wells Fargo is exploring a sale of its corporate-trust unit that could fetch more than {$1.00} XXXX and is considering whether to find a buyer for its student-loan portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter. The article goes on to say Wells Fargo holds a {$10.00} XXXX student-loan portfolio. The bank said earlier this month that it had notified customers of its planned exit from the student-lending business. As my payments began in XXXX of XXXX, WF is reporting adverse credit information to compel me, a student of non-traditional age, with a documented XXXX  XXXX, from a minority background, to obtain employment during a pandemic so that they can offset the XXXX  XXXX interest income losses of 19 percent. By forcing students into repayment during a pandemic they are attempting to hedge their losses due in the low-interest rate environment while they seek ways to divest themselves of their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollar student loan portfolio during the economic crisis to mitigate any additional losses that may affect their bottom line post-pandemic due to economic damage caused by the pandemic. 

On XXXX XXXX my account was placed into a forbearance status due to COVID-19. As of XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo lists one sub-account as being paid on-time for XX/XX/XXXX. The second sub account lists a XXXX payment as late by XXXXhirty ( 30 ) days and Both sub accounts are due on the same day of each month. I have received zero bills since forbearance was initiated. I have confirmation of being placed in forbearance as of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The notion that I may somehow be able to retrieve an electronic bill even if I do not receive a bill in the mail presupposes that I have access to the internet at all times. It takes no note that I may not have internet access due to service interruptions caused by late payments due to loss or delay of financial deposits on account of the pandemic. Furthermore, CFPB statutes and enforcement require that a bill be mailed to me each month as a part of right of notice under due process. No notice can be received if the bill never reaches me. Further, a bill that is "" generated '' but never mailed by Wells Fargo. does not suffice as notice. Finally a bill that is generated outside of the established billing period, per the first bill, is not allowed under CFPB statutes and enforcement. Now, this mismanagement of account information by Wells Fargo is not new. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Mr. XXXX XXXX responded to Wells Fargo complaints XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. To date Wells Fargo has offered me no relief for improper billing practices, nor relief for improper credit reporting. In fact, XXXX XXXX contends that Wells Fargo is provided accurate information both to myself and the CRAs. XXXX XXXX concurs with my assertion regarding the timing of my first bill, "" Your first payment for loan account XXXX XXXX and XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, a monthly billing statement was mailed to your attention, which stated your payment due date would be XX/XX/XXXX. '' However, he switches tactics when addressing all subsequent statement generation dates and instead refers to the date a payment is due, "" On XX/XX/XXXX, your monthly billing statement was mailed showing your payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, your billing statement was mailed showing the payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, you billing statement was mailed showing the payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, your billing statement was mailed showing the payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed copies for your review. '' He then excoriates me stating, "" our statement was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX, allowing you more than a 20-day notice before your first payment due date, as we provide our customers coming out of a loan forbearance additional time to make payment arrangements for their loan accounts. '' To further his point he writes regarding my MPN signed with a now defunct banking institution, "" 'I am not relieved of my responsibly and obligation to make such payments if I do not receive billing statements, and any other written payment notices from you. ' XXXX XXXX is tacitly attempting to provide an explanation as to why it is acceptable for Wells Fargo to be non-compliant with Consent Order XXXX and violate the CFPB interpretation of 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ) 1026.2 Definitions and rules of construction, effectively claiming that while Wells Fargo did not generate and provide me statements per Federal Law, their failure has no bearing on my payment history, status of my account, etc, because I am supposed to blindly make payments without consistent generation of statements. Effectively asserting, flaunting of federal law has caused no harm to me as a consumer even if their billing practices are illegal under 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ) 1026.2 Definitions and rules of construction. Now, under 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ) 1026.2 Definitions and rules of construction, while there is a permissible variance to account for weekends, holidays, and differences in the number of days in months, billing cycles MUST BE EQUAL. In this context equal requires that the actual date of EACH statement not vary by more than four ( 4 ) days from a fixed day or date. The interval between the statement with date XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and the next subsequent statement generated on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX clearly falls outside the statutory definition of equal as applied to billing cycles for my student loans. Again XXXX XXXX asserts that I have not been harmed. XXXX XXXX then goes on to assert that my payment history is accurate and provides dates from his computing system sowing when payments were made. In fact he is so confident with the screen dumb from the system which he uses for such data that he closed out complaint XXXX. Contrary to XXXX XXXX 's claim of reported payment history only furnished to the CRAs for XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo is currently reporting history thru XX/XX/XXXX, which as stated in XXXX is causally impossible given XXXX XXXX 's acknowledgment of the due date of the twenty-seventh ( XXXX ) of each month. That is Wells Fargo is reporting history thru XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, when the date of this complaint is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. So, contrary to XXXX XXXX 's claim regarding no harm to me as a consumer for their illegal billing practices, I have been harmed. The inconsistency in their statement generation as established by the first ( 1st ) billing statement generation on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and their second statement generation date on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX falls outside of the established date of XXXX day of each month and the harm caused by such is reflected in their system reporting causally impossible payment history to the CRAs. For example, Wells Fargo is supplying information to at least one ( 1 ) of the major three ( 3 ) CRAs in which my payment history goes from being reported to on-time for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, to suddenly being reported sixty ( 60 ) days past-due. Mr. XXXX XXXX 's statement to the CRA on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX are clear in that my first payment was not due until XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. So it is logically impossible that my payments would be suddenly past-due sixty ( 60 ) days for the period of XX/XX/XXXX. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo is reporting the inaccurate history to XXXX  and XXXX. This is in obvious contradiction to what Ms. XXXX XXXX claims WF is reporting to the CRAs. Moreover, WF is supplying payment history claiming that I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or more days late for the month of XXXX when the date for neither the payment due XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, nor the payment due XXXX XXXX would be thirty ( 30 ) days past-due -- today is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. If this was a simple reporting error caused by the system of a single CRA, it would be one thing. Clearly this is inaccurate and unverifiable information that is being reported to at least all three ( 3 ) major CRAs. The somewhat seriousness, but hilarity in all of this is that there is a specific portion of XXXX XXXX 's response that acknowledges consent order violations, "" We appreciate your concern about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) announcement ; we are taking all appropriate steps to remedy the concerns. Your feedback is very important to us. We hope to have a future opportunity to meet and exceed your service expectations.We are deeply committed to serving you and your financial needs. It is important for you to know that making things right and restoring the faith you have in us is the very top priority for our entire Wells Fargo leadership team. Nothing is more important than for you to experience the very best from us moving forward. '' So XXXX XXXX acknowledges that Wells Fargo is in violation of XXXX and that Wells Fargo is taking steps to remedy the non-compliance I pointed out. However, despite the illegal billing practices in violation of XXXX, and outside what is permissible under statute, Wells Fargo will do nothing to ameliorate the harm they have already caused me due to inaccurate reporting of payment history. These practices are not new, as the CFPB has issued consent orders in the past for this same behavior from Wells Fargo, specifically citing the following violations : ( 1 ) unfair and deceptive practices related to payment allocation in violation of Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( CFPA ), 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ; ( 2 ) unfair practices related to payment aggregation in violation of Sections 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ; ( 3 ) unlawful practices related to payment aggregation in violation of Section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ), and Section 1022.42 of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. 1022.42 ( a ) ; and ( 4 ) unfair practices related to the assessment of late fees in violation of Sections 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536. Per CFPB consent order 2016-CFPB-0013, the negative account information that Wells Fargo is submitting to the CRAs is incorrect and must be immediately removed. At the end of the day, Wells Fargo is doing a dance. On one hand they admit they are outside of what is statutorily permissible. However, they insist that no harm has been done because "" I still have to make payments on my student loans. '' They fail to understand that the mysterious change in statement generation date between the first two ( 2 ) consecutive statements of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, presents itself causally impossible payment history thru XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that is supplied thru eOSCAR to the CRAs. Each time I attempt to dispute this fact with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, Wells Fargo 's computing system supplies the same erroneous information. The bottom line is that errors in Wells Fargo 's own systems has caused consistent damage to my credit files since XX/XX/XXXX. Any reasonable company would take efforts to correct the situation to make me whole. Wells Fargo appears not to want to do such. To date WF has not stated they will fix the problem regarding the supply of causally impossible payment history to the CRAs for my student loans. So it would seem that WF will continue to cause harm to me as a consumer, and perhaps other consumers, with full knowledge that they are doing such, while providing no relief to me. On one hand, Wells Fargo is will to partially acknowledge the errors, but then on the other hand claim that they are reporting factually accurate payment history, and seeking to deflect away from their own behavior by quoting a clause within my loan origination documents that they acquired from a now defunct banking institution. While the clause in the loan origination document is amorphous at best in that I may still owe the alleged amount on a loan, Mr. XXXX XXXX 's claim that the clause excuses WF compliance with federal statute is absurd. The CFPB 's interpretation of 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ) 1026 is clear. Wells Fargo is not absolved of compliance to consent orders/ consent decrees, nor shields Wells Fargo from the CFPB 's enforcement of applicable statute. Wells Fargo is exhibiting behavior that is non-compliant with XXXX and is admitting they are in violation of 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ) XXXX. Wells Fargo appears content not to correct the problems with the information they are supplying to the CRAs and thus are indifferent to the harm they have caused and will continue to cause to me as a consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MI,48104,None,Consent provided,Web,02/11/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4131633
03/10/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"My finances were severely effected by the COVID- 19 pandemic. I was furloughed from my job and went on unemployment. However, due to a large amount of fraudulent cases hitting the unemployment system, my payments were placed on hold for months until the Department of Unemployment could get to my case and verify my identity. This left me with no type of income for 16 weeks. 

I applied and did receive a COVID forbearance. However, the company only offered a 30 day forbearance. After 30 days, I was still unable to make a payment because I still did not have any income. 

XXXX XXXX reported my account 60 days late to the credit bureau. This dropped my score 89 points. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$160.00} to bring my account current. I then reached out to the company to see if the late payment could be removed from my credit as a one-time courtesy since I've never been late on a payment and the reasons that I was late was beyond my control. I was told that I would have to write a letter to the dispute department which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to follow-up on the letter. I was never given an option to speak with anyone directly in the dispute department. I was then told that I would have to dispute it directly with the credit bureaus. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I opened a dispute with XXXX. XXXX XXXX replied back to the dispute stating that everything is correct.

03/22/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I recently received an updated payment schedule for my loan and I need to understand the information you provided. 


Point 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX statement my balance was {$80000.00} + {$1300.00} in accrued interest for a total of {$81000.00}. 

Since I paid {$3100.00} since XX/XX/XXXX, it leaves me with a balance of {$78000.00} which shows on the XX/XX/XXXX statement. 

However you wrote to me in XX/XX/XXXX that I had 120 payments left at {$940.00} a month and my estimated interest over the life of the loan was {$32000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX you still show 120 payments remaining at {$940.00} per month and you estimate my future interest payments at {$34000.00}. 

That is an increase of {$2500.00} in interest!! 

How is it possible that the full amount of my interest over the life of the loan is increasing even though I am making payments and no interest is being added because there has been a freezing of interest on the student loan by the Federal government? 

Point 2 ) In addition I had previously requested, in my email on XXXX XXXX to the XXXX, an amortization schedule showing how my monthly payments are being applied and how the interest is being calculated. What interest rate am I really paying!! I am entitled to transparency. XXXX, a Loan Servicing Specialist responded via letter and writes "" We are unable to provide calculations regarding how this payment was calculated '' That is absurd! 
I need an amortization schedule. 

Point 3 ) I did my own amortization schedule and based on the principal, payment amount, and 120 months the interest rate was almost 7.85 %!! That is exorbitant and way above current market conditions. I need to reschedule the loan at a lower interest rate or forgiven. 

Point 4 ) My XXXX student loan was {$80000.00} and you deducted 4.248 % as origination fee and on my XXXX loan of {$20000.00} you again deducted about 1 %. So you lent me {$100000.00} total but you only gave XXXX {$96000.00} a difference of {$3600.00}. You also charged me accrued interest {$1300.00} on Loan # 1 and {$310.00} on loan # 2!! totaling {$1600.00} while I am still in school ( I have not graduated as yet ). Also even though I am making payments my interest seems to be increasing. I needed help to be able to further my career and I am left with a toxic loan that doesn't allow me to follow my dreams. 

As I am just about to start my career with the tools that I learned at XXXX over the last 2 years, you have really made my life unnecessarily difficult by charging me so much at this crucial time in my career and at an important moment in the history of the United States as well. My income is very low and I am having difficulty making ends meet. I need some large help with the loan repayment.

At first, I was paying a lender called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( since approx. XXXX ), which then became Younomics at some point in approx. XXXX. Given the HIGH interest rate on the loan, and the fact that I have student debt around {$150000.00}, I worked out a payment plan with Younomics, with me paying approximately $ XXXX towards what started out as a ~ {$20000.00} loan. Given the high interest rate ( which I find unconscionable, and I'm not even sure which loan this is because I never borrowed from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), you can imagine that {$150.00} is a drop in the bucket. Even after paying for almost 10 years, my principal amount has not gone down. However, this is what I can afford given the amount of money I pay towards other student loans, housing, etc. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, when I tried to renew my payment plan as I had been doing every year for several years, I received a response with a three page document asking for a litany of information that I don't believe a lender is entitled to, including my income, every other loan I am responsible for ( including monthly payments and amount outstanding ), my monthly budget in every aspect ( food, utilities, support payments, insurance, other ), my account balances, my employer, my account numbers, my SSN, etc. It was invasive and I refused to fill it out. The email response I received when I asked why I had to fill out this form when I never had to before was, "" This is the new process now. '' It seems unconscionable to me that a lender can change its terms/processes without any notice to the borrower. 

I continued to pay the amount I had been paying and refused to fill out the new form. Since I refused to fill out the form, the payment arrangement expired and my monthly payment amount went up significantly. I can not afford this. The loan then apparently transferred to a company called XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has been reaching out in the last year, and I gather they are a debt collector. I've emailed XXXX numerous times in XXXX asking them to prove they have the legal right to collect on this loan - they have not responded. They have put multiple bad marks on my credit score. 

I understand that I am responsible for the student debt I took out, but I am drowning in student loan payments. This is a private loan that I took in college, when I was 18-21 years old, without any real understanding of what interest, APR, etc. meant.

The first time I called the customer service agent gave me a one month forbearance for XXXX and told me that I would have to recertify on paper instead of electronically if I couldn't go through DOE as that was a separate website. I do not understand how ASPIRE can require me to recertify my income when the DOE says it's not necessary. I have not received anything from my other loan holder as I think they are following the rules. 
The second time I called I was given the same runaround that I would have to recertify through the mail. I do not own/have access to a printer to print relevant documents, and there is a requirement when you sign that you agree to provide relevant documents. They have not provided an electronic means and the closest printing service to me is a 3 mile walk as I have no car.

I am currently on XXXX and held a Nelnet Federal Loan as well. The Federal loan was forgiven. The Nelnet /Firstmark private loan they will not forgive. 

I am XXXX years old and on Social Security XXXX. I took the loan out when I was a single mother struggling to pay my bills and went to school to be a XXXX  where I never made any more than {$3200.00} a year. The loan of {$12000.00} was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX at a variable rate of 4.750 % and the current balance of {$13000.00} ( 15 ) years later. My ex-husband was a cosigner on this and they continue to call him for payment. I have asked that they stop since we have been divorced since XXXX but they continue to call him. They refuse to forgive the loan as they say that the underwriter will not permit it since it works differently than my Federal Loan. The idea that I need to pay this in full or at all seems to make no sense at all. Firstmark continues to report to credit agencies as in collections since I have not paid anything on these loans and my credit rating is suffering. My ex-husband 's credit is also affected. I am told there is no more forbearance left on this account, current covid relief for student loans does not apply. There are no payment adjustments and no forgiveness for this loan. I would appreciate any help, suggestions, guidance as to how to navigate this. It seems ironic that after graduation, I worked as a XXXX for plaintiffs attorneys and clients that were injured and/or taken of financially while making very little money while supporting myself and my daughters as a single Mom and now that Im XXXX years old on Social Security XXXX Im dealing with this.

03/17/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"This is the letter I sent to XXXX XXXX : I graduated from University XXXX Wisconsin XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I technically was done with school in XX/XX/XXXX as I had a final XXXX class to complete. I participated in the graduation ceremony in XX/XX/XXXX. I have been in repayment on my student loans since mid-year XXXX at least. 
My student loan servicer was Great Lakes for quite some time. I made regular payments to them as soon as I was required to do so. I always made biweekly payments ( a payment every time I was paid from my job ). I had these payments going out through my bill pay account automatically. I always completed any renewals required of me, submitted any verification requested and provided verification of my public service employment. I NEVER requested any deferments or forbearances at any point since Ive been in repayment. 
I refinanced to XXXX XXXX in XXXX as I heard this was the servicer one needed to be using in order to qualify for the PSLF program. After the financing was completed, I noticed they only counted a minimal number of the monthly payments I had made toward the PSLF. I contacted both XXXX XXXX and Great Lakes a MULTITUDE of times requesting verification of my requests for deferment or forbearance on my student loans since my graduation. This request has never been able to be provided to me. Additionally, I have requested from Great Lakes my payment history since the inception of my repayments MANY times and have never been successful in ascertaining specifically what Ive requested. 
After about the 100th time calling XXXX XXXX requesting answers, I spoke to a wonderful agent who listened to me cry and told me if I could provide verification of the payments I made to my student loans they could be counted toward the PSLF program even if I was in deferment or forbearance ( despite me NEVER requesting these!! ). This was the best news I could possibly receive, although it is devastating someone couldnt have told me these years earlier. Unfortunately, my banking information only goes back 7 years so I am unable to produce record of any of my payments from XXXX and XXXX ( except for XX/XX/XXXX ) because of this. Had this information been relayed to me the numerous other times I called, I would have been able to obtain these records. Additionally, if Great Lakes would provide me the correct information Ive requested multiple times, I would also be able to document my payment history back to XXXX. The ONLY time I was ever in Deferment was when I enrolled in school again in Spring of XXXX but that was an In-School Deferment. 
I am sending in EVERY SINGLE BANK STATEMENT I have back to XX/XX/XXXX with each payment Ive made highlighted. Ive also created a spreadsheet detailing the year of the payments and the corresponding dates. I have tallied how many payments Ive actually made and counted the totaled the dollar amount Ive actually paid. In counting the number of payments made I counted biweekly payments as ONE payment per month. Additionally, I have included current forms from my current and past employers, which have also been sent in before and approved, but I wanted to cover ALL my bases. 

I have been in Public Service employment Full-Time since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never neglected to turn in the information requested/required of me. I should be in my FINAL year of the PSLF but because of the negligence of the student loan servicers, I am looking at spending MANY more years for the opportunity to save me from this crippling debt. Due to the inability of student loan services, I am to the point of contacting my legislatures and the President to make them aware of how excruciating the process is and the lack of proper information/communication from servicers. Im unsure if its a lack of training of the agents who answer the phone or if this information is kept secretive so people never reach the requirements to qualify. 
Im requesting a thorough review of my information and a written and phone response, particularly from an experienced and competent manager/director with the result of this review. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WI XXXX XXXX ( Former Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WI XXXX ) Schools Attended : XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX Wisconsin XXXX XXXX University XXXX Wisconsin XXXX XXXX Iowa University XXXX XXXX University Additional Information : I also filed a complaint with Great Lakes Higher Education and it has been escalated to a Customer Experience Response Team to address. I received the emailing telling me that on XX/XX/XXXX and have not heard anything since. I was informed by another agent at XXXX XXXX that even though I made payments they can not be counted toward loan forgiveness because I was supposedly in a deferment or forbearance which is not accurate. So again, I was told different information by different agents at XXXX. My issues are both with XXXX  and Great Lakes but MOST importantly with Great Lakes at this time because they are the ones who supplied incorrect information to XXXX saying I was in deferment/forbearance. I have contacted Great Lakes on numerous occasions requesting my payment history since the beginning and any requests from ME requesting a deferment or forbearance. This has never been produced by them. Additionally I have major problems with XXXX certifying my employer. They are constantly asking for additional information and one minute they'll tell me the employer is certified and the next minute they're not. It makes NO sense! 

I need help. I should only have 11 payments left before being able to apply for PSLF. They are not counting 42 of my payments because of this supposed deferment/forbearance.

I then sent a detailed letter to FedLoan and I do not think that XXXX sent them all my information as far as payments. I do not know why and how the representative would tell me that I qualified if all payments were not in their system. I sent all the information from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to Fedloan and to this date have no received any updated information. I have attended to school for quite some time, with no degree, and am appalled that I have to send a letter in order to protect myself. 

I have some enclosed documents that I want to share and get clarification on. 

Report from XXXX. I do not know how I obtained this but glad it is within my hands.

1. There is a total of XXXX Forbearance lines within this report. They go back to the year of XXXX. I never recall putting any loan that I have had within Forbearance. I will need to see all signed documentation or recorded phone call where I did this. If no documentation can be obtained please update all loans that state there was a Forbearance. 
2. There are schools where I know I signed up but never attended within this report. I know that I withdrew from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Signed documentation is needed for these loan that are on this report. I never recall attending XXXX XXXX  and signed documentation will be needed to justify these loans to this school. 
3. There are lines that there were loans that went to XXXX XXXX for Consolidation Loans. Who is this and why is there no school listed like the other loans. I will need signed documentation for this as well. If no documentation can be obtained I will need these loans removed from my transcript. 
4. XXXX XXXX was a promises school where as they stated that if I graduated from their college I was guaranteed a job. Once enrolled I just seen the tuition higher and higher, partially the main reason I am in so much school debt, so I did not re-enroll. It seemed as they were only for profit. 

XXXX correspondences ( dated XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX ) 1. There are several loans within these documents that need to be counted towards my Public Student Loan Forgiveness. All this information was submitted to Fedloan but never updated.

Court brief where I am listed as a litigant with the student loan predatory lending 1. This brief shows that some of these loans were offered to me and should not have. I am just trying to get my loans under control. At this time, I could not even go back to school as I have exhausted all federal help with no degree. 

I would like all this investigated. I have worked for the XXXX of XXXX  since XX/XX/XXXX. My XXXX years has exhausted. According to all information provided, I should have XXXX payments and qualify for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I eagerly await your reply.

02/03/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I have attached documents to support my case : It has been brought to my attention recently a collection agency, Account Control Technology has illegally charged interest on my federal student loans between the dates of XX/XX/XXXX to current. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act became law, providing relief measures on Education Department owned federal student loans. This law has been extended to XX/XX/XXXX. Under this law, interest rate is 0 % for federal student loans, even those in default. My loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education and serviced by XXXX ( refer to XXXX  page dated XXXX ) who is a loan servicer for the U.S Department of Education. 

Please refer to the XXXX page dated XX/XX/XXXX. This was the last paperwork that I received about my student loans until the week of XX/XX/XXXX. You will see at this time ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I owed {$39000.00} total with interest. I do understand there are 23 more days of interest being added to my loans till the Cares Act became law. In this 23 day period, there is no way over {$2500.00} dollars in interest could be added. 

Please refer to the ACT paperwork dated XXXX XXXX. According to ACT, {$2500.00} in interest has been added since XX/XX/XXXX. 
Account Control Technology is breaking ( 2 ) laws that I know of according to the Cares Act : 1. Collections of federal student loans owned by the Department of Education must stop under Cares Act.

2. Interest has been charged to my Student loans under the Cares Act, which is illegal.

I hope legal action can be taken against ACT and whoever else might be involved in this theft and deception immediately.

I have listed some of the Laws from the Cares Act related to my case. 

The following information was found on studentaid.gov. 

https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus On XX/XX/XXXX, the office of Federal Student Aid began providing the following temporary relief on ED-owned federal student loans : suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on defaulted loans, and a 0 % interest rate. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act ) became law, providing for the above relief measures on ED-owned federal student loans through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended on ED-owned federal student loans through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended on ED-owned federal student loans through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended on ED-owned federal student loans through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
0 % Loan Interest Interest is being temporarily set at 0 % on federal student loans. Which loans does the 0 % rate apply to? 
From XX/XX/XXXX, through the end of the COVID emergency relief period, the interest rate is 0 % on the following types of federal student loans, but only if they are loans owned by ED : Defaulted and nondefaulted Direct Loans Defaulted and nondefaulted FFEL Program loans Defaulted and nondefaulted Federal Perkins Loans Defaulted HEAL loans Please note that some FFEL Program and HEAL loans are owned by commercial lenders, and some Perkins Loans are owned by the institution you attended. These loans are not eligible for this benefit at this time, but you can contact your servicer to ask about what benefits may be available.

To find out if your Direct and FFEL Program loans are owned by ED, visit StudentAid.gov/login. After you log in with your FSA ID, you will be on your StudentAid.gov dashboard. If you click on view details, you will be taken to your Aid Summary. If you scroll down on this page, you will see a section called Loan Breakdown. In your Loan Breakdown, if you see a servicer name that starts with DEPT OF ED, that servicer is for a loan that is owned by ED.

https : //studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers The following are loan servicers for loans that the U.S Department of Education ( ED ) owns. To find out who your loan servicer is, call the Federal Student Aid Information Center ( FSAIC ) at XXXX.

XXXX XXXX/XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXp ( also known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX ( TTY : XXXX for the deaf or hard of hearing ) Understanding Loan Transfers In some cases, we need to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer. If we transfer your federal student loans from one servicer to another servicer, your loans will still be owned by ED. The transfer to another servicer simply means that a new servicer will provide the support you need to fully repay your loans. 
Heres what you should expect if your loan is transferred to a new servicer : You will receive an email or a letter from your assigned servicer to inform you about the transfer.

You will receive a welcome letter from the new servicer after the new servicer receives your loans. This notice will provide you with the contact information for the new servicer and inform you of actions that you may need to take.

All of your loan information will be transferred from your assigned servicer to your new servicer, but you may only be able to see online information that covers the period since your new servicer took your loans over.

There will be no change in the terms of your loans.

Your previous loan servicer and new loan servicer will work together to make sure that all payments you make during the transfer process are credited to your loan account with the new servicer.

After you receive the welcome letter from your new servicer, you should do the following : Begin sending your loan payments to your new servicer. If you use a bank or bill paying service to make your loan payments, update the new servicers contact information with the bank or bill paying service.

Follow the new servicers instructions for creating an online account so that you can more easily communicate with the new servicer and keep track of your loan account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Account Control Technology, Inc.",AR,71923,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/03/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4115104
03/26/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am seeking your assistance with this matter. I am requesting transparency about a debt I owe and Navient the Loan company that houses the debt is refusing to assist. They utilized predatory tactics to increase the amount I owe. Then when I question both the tactic ( s ) and the amount that was added, Im offered a little and vague response. I am requesting my loan be adjusted to the original amount of {$59000.00} as it is very clear that Navient is wrong in this matter and will not work to resolve the matter. I worked very hard to get to a place to pay my debt. I will not be taken advantage of as Navient is well documented for doing to its customers. Please assist me with this matter. 


My original request sought transparency and detail. The amount of XXXX was cited but full detail and validation was not provided. It is the law to validate a debt. I was provided the amount of {$12000.00} and calculation of interest. The original amount was {$59000.00}. There is nearly {$5000.00} unaccounted for in the explanation which proves my point from the original letter that this interest was fraudulently charged. I have defense as a borrower. I was baited to take forbearances and Income based payment options in an effort to drive up my loan balance and not help me to decrease my balance. There is no explanation of unsubsidized vs subsidized and the amounts of interest charged to both. Interest was illegally charged and goes against what was stated in the promissory note as regards to charge interest during forbearance. I was charged that and more. Taking full advantage of me as a buyer. I will not pay anything more than the {$59000.00} amount as I have clearly been wronged by Navient. Please validate this date as cited below. 
The name and address of the original creditor, the account number, and the amount owed. 
Verification that there is a valid basis for claiming I am required to pay the current amount owed. 
Details about the age and amount of the debt including a copy of the last billing statement from the original creditor ; a detailed explanation of any interest added or payments made since the last billing statement and the legal authorization for this interest ; the date the original creditor claims this debt became delinquent. 
Please also note whether this debt is within the statute of limitations and how that was determined. 
Please also forward details about your authority to collect this debt : whether you are licensed in my state and if so provide the date of the license, name on the license, license number, and the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license. If you are contacting me from outside my state, provide the licensing information from your state as well. 

I was never advised of the overall impact of the debt. I was never advised of how interest would be capitalized or how it would accumulate in detail. A calculation of interest was vaguely explained in a letter and not in any documentation that I endorsed. Countless promotion of forbearances and income driven payment was a very predatory tactic. The promissory note I endorsed says may be added, does not specify deferment periods. The language is vague and misleading. Navient is a company that likes to take advantage of borrowers rather than promote financial literacy in which both borrower and company benefit. 

Navient is required by law to provide notice of interest capitalizing 30 days prior. I've never received any notice that details interest accumulation or capitalization of interest. Below is law which Navient has never abided by. 


( 1 ) The lender and the borrower or endorser agree to the terms of the forbearance and, unless the agreement was in writing, the lender sends, within 30 days, a notice to the borrower or endorser confirming the terms of the forbearance and records the terms of the forbearance in the borrower 's file ; or ( 2 ) In the case of forbearance of interest during a period of deferment, if the lender informs the borrower at the time the deferment is granted that interest payments are to be forborne. 

( c ) Except as provided in paragraph ( d ) ( 2 ) of this section, a lender may grant forbearance for a period of up to one year at a time if both the borrower or endorser and an authorized official of the lender agree to the terms of the forbearance. If the borrower or endorser requests the forbearance orally and the lender and the borrower or endorser agree to the terms of the forbearance orally, the lender must notify the borrower or endorser of the terms within 30 days of that agreement. 


I was baited and steered into forbearance and income driven, now I have $ XXXX in unexplained debt. Any legal debt should be validated prior to paying. I have not received any clarity/transparency on the $ XXXX interest and Navient refuses to provide it. I have never paid a debt that was not validated and I will not start now. I am requesting to start from the {$59000.00} original amount that I am responsible for. I will not be paying that $ XXXX in unexplained charges and fully expect my loan amount to be adjusted to {$59000.00}. I will be retaining legal counsel on this matter.

02/12/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I enrolled in a training program for XXXX  school in XX/XX/XXXX. I was unable to obtain the certification due to medical. I withdrew from class and from there the problems started with Great Lakes. Over the course of 6 years, I continued to explain to Great Lakes what happened, I had only attended 1 class and withdrew due to medical. I was told I was still responsible for the loan because I had signed a master agreement. In XX/XX/XXXX ( 6+ years ) the loan defaulted and was sent to a different federal agency for collection. It should not have been sent to a collection agency, as I was actively disputing it with Great Lakes but they did it anyways. I have written correspondence with the company during the month of XX/XX/XXXX questioning, as I alway had the validity of the debt. They have a log of my calls in XX/XX/XXXX but conveniently the recordings are gone to validate I was in an active dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the new federal collection company and explained what happened back in XXXX. I was immediately asked why I had not completed the following : LOAN DISCHARGE APPLICATION : FALSE CERTIFICATION ( DISQUALIFYING STATUS ). I had no idea what they were referring to. The resolution had never been offered by Great Lakes, which would of resulted in my loan being discharged and all negative credit reporting being removed. 

I spoke to Great Lakes in depth on XX/XX/XXXX, who acknowledges I had never been offered the remedy but was told it wasnt their responsibility to offer me anything. How is that possible when this is a company governed to provide federal loans and the discharge is a federal program and remedy available? I simply asked them to delete the negative reporting or delete my file, while I work thru the discharge which can take 6-8 weeks or more. After all, had I been offered what I was legally entitled to, I wouldnt of been in the situation for a defaulted loan. 


The damage I have suffered financially is devastating due to their actions. I have been denied housing and credit. What credit I could obtain has been subprime rates, further resulting in irreparable harm to myself. I would calculate my losses due to their negligence to exceed {$100000.00} over the course of 10 years, since the loan became active. 

Great Lakes is currently in a active class action lawsuit for their predatory lending practices. I am not part of the lawsuit. 

I have asked for records of showing where I accepted deferments and why they held onto a loan for almost 7 years when the standard is 3 years before sending to collections? Was if so they could continue to add interest to the unpaid balance? I have asked for explanation of why I was not offered the remedy available to me. I have asked why am I being denied a goodwill adjustment, to delete the file and close this horrid experience out and was told what they do for others is of on concern to me. Is it because Im XXXX? Is systematic racism in play? What is the real reason they continue to hold this {$2000.00} defaulted loan that I am not responsible for over my head and continue to actively be a part of destroying my credit? How can they legally pick and choose who to help when it was them who played a major role by not offering the proper legal remedy available ever? 

I attached files. One is an email to my XXXX  instructor. Note the date and content of message indicating I would complete my physical on Monday. The other attachment is the withdraw record. Note the withdrawal date from the school. It is the Tuesday, the day immediately following my medical physical when I leaned I could never hold a XXXX  license.

Public release statements from President, Department of Education  and XXXX XXXX XXXX  state addressing student loans : student loan payment pause, auto forbearance, no interest and no late fees. ( see attached ) XXXX Trump suspends student loan payments through XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? XXXX XXXX Original coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act and signed into law on XX/XX/XXXX, helped most federal student loan borrowers by temporarily pausing payments ... executive action will automatically continue the pause on federal student loan payment XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : XXXX XXXX US government automatically suspended payments and waived interest on federal student loans through XXXX. Trump later moved the expiration date to the end of the year by executive order. 
The suspension and interest waiver applied only to federally held loans, which covered roughly 85 % of federal student loans. That included loans known as Direct federal loans, as well as PLUS loans that parents may have taken out on behalf of their children. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX extends student loan payment pause for 42 million borrowers amid covid crisis ... Federal student loan borrowers dont need to resume making their monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Biden extends student loan payment deferrals until XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Since XXXX, all federal student loan payments have been suspended as part of the federal government Covid 19 response XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX/ Even with numerous public statements, Navient continued to charge late fees XXXX interest and blatantly disregarded my request for a forbearance. Yet, Navient took it upon themselves to capriciously auto forbearance when Texas experienced power outage?! Then arbitrarily released it when they deemed fitting. 

In fact, Navient in an email XXXX wrote We previously granted a national emergency forbearance on your Federal student loans due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Your forbearance has expired and your account is now past due. 

That is most interesting as I never inquired about a Covid forbearance during this time, I was making monthly payments. After watching the aforementioned public releases, I contact Navient. To date, Navient has demonstrated cavalier, what feels like capricious servicing in deciding when a forbearance is issued and when it is retracted. In fact, they dont recognize my written request. 

XXXX Asking why student loans are being charged interest and late fees after the President and Depart of Education froze student loans per numerous public release statements. ( attached ) Navient responds back alleging unable to discuss specific information via email. Were able to assist you via phone, just call XXXX ( see attached ) XXXX Navient sent an email claiming you may qualify to reduce or postpone federal student loan payments I responded will Navient be recognizing and adhering to the federal student loan payment freeze including interest? ( see attached ) As a result of Navient not freezing student loan payment, interest and late fee occurring, I emailed Department of Education and requested clarity. 

On XXXX The Department of Education responded via email stating All federal student loans are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance that allows you to stop making your payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX. The interest rate for Federal Direct Loans has been temporarily set to 0 % starting XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX ( see attached ) This email was forwarded to Navient. 

A second email from StudentAid.gov specifically states All federal student loans are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance that allows you to stop making your payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 
The interest rate for Federal Direct Loans has been temporarily set to 0 %, starting XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. Federal Family Education Loans ( FFEL ) and XXXX XXXX owned by the Department of Education ( ED ) are also included. 
Defaulted loans owned by ED will not accrue interest from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. 
That includes Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans owned by ED. 
By XXXX Navient sent an email stating we havent received a payment from you. 

In response, XXXX, I sent another email to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX restating the email from XXXX. Requesting forbearance and interest adjusted according to recent public releases. ( Recall from above the student loans are supposed to be on auto forbearance stated publicly by President, Dept of Education and also XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, all of which was provided to Navient ; yet, my loans are accruing interest and late fees. ) After no response from Navient, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX were again sent the email directly from Department of Education pertaining to student loan payments, interest and late fees. Requesting forbearance on the account, in alignment with the email from Department of Education. 

You can imagine my surprise, on XXXX to get an invoice from Navient requesting a payment for {$350.00}. That is quite a distance from the standard {$85.00} per month. On the same day, XXXX XXXX with Navient sends an email claiming you may qualify to reduce or postpone your federal student loan payments. In response, I forward to Ms. XXXX the email from Department of Education regarding student loans, interest and late fees. In the email I mention my 3rd request for a forbearance, that up to this point, is still not on the account. 

Navient replied on XXXX claiming were unable to discuss specific account information via email and requested I call. 

Come XXXX Navient arbitrarily and capricious placed my student loan on forbearance due to natural disaster in Texas. 

By this point of waiting hours on the phone to speak to someone with Navient, which is not realistic for anyones schedule. I sent an email to XXXX. Identified in great detail the inability for Navient to answer a few basic questions regarding the Presidents executive order, Department of Education public release statements and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX reports. My email included the many sources for reference, requesting interest be adjusted on my account to align with the public policy. In addition, I also supplied the advocate a historical record of where interest and late fees were being charged, which did not align with current public policy, collaborated by the email from Dept. of Education. And the most recent statement showing payment increased from {$85.00} to {$350.00} per month. Another written request for a forbearance was included in the email. 

Office of Customer Advocate, XXXX XXXX. Mrs. XXXX ( XXXX ) replied in an email claiming ONLY Department of Education loans are eligible for relief. She proceeds to claim my student loans are not eligible for interest waiver or automatic payment suspensions. Dept. of Education clearly states All federal student loans are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance that allows you to stop making your payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. The interest rate for Federal Direct Loans has been temporarily set to 0 %, starting XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. Federal Family Education Loans ( FFEL ) and Perkins Loans owned by the Department of Education ( ED ) are also included. Defaulted loans owned by ED will not accrue interest from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX.That includes Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans owned by ED. 
She continues to claim forbearance is available for borrowers who request it. I have requested in writing numerous times ; and yet, never received it. 

Within a day of bringing the inflated payment schedule change to Ms. XXXX attention, the following day XXXX I received an email reflecting the expected {$85.00} payment due. 

Up to this point, I have requested a forbearance 3x in writing and have not received it. 

Mrs. XXXX continues on to admit a natural disaster forbearance was applied to loans from Texas on XXXX, citing the next payment is due XXXX. 

Ms. XXXX prefers to send emails where they are encrypted. Due to the method in which she sends the emails, they require a computer to open them. The password protected document may not be able to be opened on any mobile device such as a phone or tablet. We suggest that you open the document with either a laptop or desktop computer. If one is not near or have available either a laptop or desktop the customer can not open the email. 

XXXX I responded to Mr. XXXX ( XXXX ) citing the reason I contacted the Department of Education to clarify for interpretation the Department of Education official stance on student loan repayments and who they did and did not cover. In fact, Department of Education email states all student loans. Inquired about the repeated forbearance, that has yet to be applied nor request acknowledged. Requested a forbearance. 

After emailing Navient the email directly from Department of Education stating all student loans, Ms. XXXX notifies me they now need to research the account. ( Recall a while back, Navient, was given the email from Department of Education a few times along with multiple URLs regarding Presidential executive orders ) To add to frustration, Navient continued to address me by the incorrect gender, after correcting them more than once.

Student Loan repayments are difficult enough given the mandated lockdowns, people losing their jobs, depleting savings and trying to stay afloat. When public officials who regulate students loans from the President a
nd Dept. of Education issue a written statement about student loans, is the servicer in a position to interpret what that means? 

So, a student loan servicer can issue a forbearance at their whim ; but disregard a customers request to get one?

A payment jumps from {$85.00} to over {$350.00} in one month with little to no explanation? Yet, when it is brought to Navients attention, within days it is corrected? What if the customer had not caught it and auto paid it?

Additional concerns : 1. The balance on Studentaid.gov is different than Navient is reporting. 2. StudentAid.gov shows a forbearance status ; yet Navient site does not report a forbearance status. 
3. Studentaid.gov cite is not showing the late fees and interest as Navient site is assessing 4. The student loans FFELP are specifically mentioned in Department of Education email surrounding : 0 %, late fees and forbearance.

03/15/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Hello, Towards the beginning of the pandemic when the CARES Act was implemented I received notice in my email that my loans were set to 0 % interest and on hold. Like many people, though, I was not aware that that didn't apply to FFELP loans, which I didn't know were distinct from Federal Loans - they were always referred to as XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX so I assumed references to federal loans included this loan. 

It wasn't until I started getting aggressive collection calls from Navient that I learned that my old loan slipped through the federal relief cracks and that I was significantly delinquent with them. I hadn't lost my job or anything but my situation is potentially precarious so I was counting on having the benefit of the Cares Act to be able to save my money instead. I'm living in XXXX on a temporary work visa tied to my current job - should I lose my job I'll have to move out of the country immediately. 

At that time I perused the website looking for the various relief options. They only allowed very short term deferment requiring ample documentation ( and my situation wouldn't have been accepted according to their survey ), IDR/IBR ( I wouldn't have been able to get a lower payment anyway ), or forbearance. XXXX XXXX XXXX  was listed at the very bottom of the website 's options but all they had to say about it was that it would combine all loan payments into one payment - nothing about how it would make the XXXX the owners of my loan and thus eligible for federal COVID relief. 

I sent an email for help to which I received the attached response ( they don't accept regular emails - you have to use their help contact form and you receive a response attached in an image file or PDF that you can't reply directly to - the emails I'm attaching are those responses ). As you can see, they never suggested consolidation as an option. I decided to bite the bullet and just pay up when I could. 

It was only a few days ago when researching student loan forums about the issue of potential loan forgiveness and what would be done with FFELP loans that I learned that I could have easily converted my loan to a direct federal loan at the beginning of the pandemic and I wouldn't have had to be paying anything all year and I wouldn't have been accruing any interest. Needless to say, I was extremely angry that Navient got ahold of money that could end up being vital for me if the worst case scenario happens ( not to mention that I could just have taken that money that I would have been holding back and paid a large lump sum to the principal before the payment/interest freeze finally expires instead of having a bunch of it go towards interest ). 

It's clear they're making no attempt to adequately educate their borrowers about the FFELP vs federally-held loan distinction, what our rights are, what our best interests would be, etc. Instead they choose to take advantage of the situation and the confusion to continue to extract interest and potentially push us into forbearance which will lock us into the perpetual debt cycle ( they literally sent out emails during this pandemic saying, "" Reply yes to put your loan into forbearance '' which would LITERALLY put your loan into forbearance with a simple reply of "" yes '' which I find to be, quite frankly, predatory behavior ). 

I'm attaching two PDF emails : one where I first asked for options for halting payments in my situation - you will see that consolidation was not mentioned at all. The second one is the latest response to my email complaining about their lack of information about consolidation, informing them that I had already applied for consolidation, and requesting a refund of my payments made over the last year. You'll see that the person responding doesn't seem to actually understand my email. She doesn't mention consolidation, and just proposes applying for XXXX ( clearly didn't read the part about me consolidating ... ). 

I've also included screenshots of their resources for halting/changing payments : their help portal as well as their little chat bot. I typed Cares Act into the chat box and the subsequent "" conversation '' is what it spit out. Both resources never propose consolidation. If you do a direct query of consolidation you'll see that their response isn't really clear about what you're consolidating - you would have to know what it is to know what they're talking about and what the benefits are or to even ask for it.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,94546,None,Consent provided,Web,03/15/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4214984

02/07/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"I received my XXXX degree 1998 from XXXX XXXX, funded in full by student loans. Unfortunately, my degree didn't quite prepare me for a future XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I had to take some additional coursework in order to enroll in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXere in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, again adding to my growing student loan balance. Upon enrolling at XXXX, I was advised that I'd be eligible to apply for Teacher Loan Forgiveness after 5 years of teaching as a Special XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am sure you can only imagine my disappointment when I received a notification from Sallie Mae that my application was denied due to the type of loans I had, and the date they were taken. When I received the rejection letter I reached out to Sallie Mae and the Dept of Education and both failed to give any guidance on how to best handle the situation or to help get me on the right payment plan. No one ever suggested that I consolidate my loans into federal loans, and no one explained the type of loans. In fact the Dept of Ed suggested I might qualify for Public Loan Forgiveness which I now know that the type of loans I hold, would have also made me illegible. 

To add insult to injury I was laid off by the XXXX on two separate occasions. Feeling disenfranchised by the lay-off 's and the loan forgiveness rejection, on top of having two small kids that required me to have stable employment, I left the field. My loans have remained in deferment, accruing more and more interest. The minimum payments have not been affordable and my student loan balance is now greater than our mortgage balance. At this rate, these loans will likely outlive me. I have reached out to Navient who now services my loans on multiple occasions for help with my payment and have received virtually no support. It was only when I reached out to find out why my loans weren't receiving the CARES program benefit of 0 interest that I was told my loan type was not eligible and that I would have to apply for a direct consolidation first ( now adding more interest to the loan ). 

Out of desperation I reached out to the executive team at Navient explaining my situation in hopes that they might work with me to restructure these loans so that I can begin to pay them off and they did nothing. I also filed a complaint with the office of the Ombudsman but that was closed, only referring me back to Navient. I also emailed XXXX and have not heard back. In addition, I filled out the application for Borrower Defense as I feel I was really misled about the type of loans I have, misled about the promise of loan forgiveness, and about my career potential in the field. Given the dates I received both degrees, I think that I am outside the statute of limitations here. Most recently I discovered that XXXX XXXX  owns my loans and I reached out to them to see if they could offer any help in restructuring these loans to help with the accrued interest, given my circumstances. While I understand I took out these loans, I had no say in who owned them. I am really at a loss as to what to do here.

I was watching the payments and everything was going fine. But last XXXX, I got a new debit card. I forgot to contact the company to make sure they had the correct one one file. But the company waited four months to contact me and ask for a payment. They waited until the account moved to the collections department to reach out. At which point they harrassed me with phone calls and emails four times a week. One week they called me twice in one day. That last for a solid month. I called them and made a payment. But they told me I still owed money just to get it out of collections. I asked for documentation that they would not have my card information on file and that I would also receive the terms and agreements of my account. I asked for certified mail. Never received it. During that phone call they continued to use predatory tactics which caused me to panic. It triggered a recent trauma and the cops were called for a welfare check on me.

I call them on the XXXX to make a payment. The woman tells me I do not have any late fees. So now they are using false information to bait me into making payments.

XXXX told me that my loan would have to be transferred to FedLoan Servicing because that is the only servicer which handles PSLF.

According to my calculations, I was finished with my 120 payments in XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for PSLF on XX/XX/XXXX. My application was denied on XX/XX/XXXX due to not making enough payments. I am only being credited with 8 payments even though my income based payments are automatically drafted two weeks before the payment due date, and have been since the very first payment. 

I provided FedLoan Servicing with proof of when my payments were to begin as well as my complete transaction history from XXXX that shows the payments that are not showing up in their system. 

FedLoan Servicing only took two weeks to deny my application. It has been nearly a month since I provided them with my supporting documentation, and they have not adjusted anything on my account. 

Below are the notes from some of my phone calls and attempts to get a payment count and loan forgiveness.

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX - Asked how long the payment review would take, and he said there was no set time. Said they loans arrived there yesterday. I told him there was only one payment showing instead of 120. I asked if he could see the notes in his files from when I spoke to operators XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. He said it would be closer to a month. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Spoke to a FedLoan Servicing operator who said that I needed to go ahead and apply for forgiveness if I felt that I had made the correct number of payments. My application would be moved to a pile to be processed more quickly. PSLF application submitted. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received a letter from FedLoan Servicing saying my application was denied because I did not make the correct number of qualifying payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX & XXXX - Flagging for review. Operator said he submitted another review and it is showing pending status. 

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX - Said that I needed to contact XXXX because XXXX didnt send my payments. I asked to speak to a supervisor. FedLoan Servicing XXXX - Said he added me to the expedited list to have my payment history review. Said it could take a couple of weeks or several months. Said that my payment history did not parse correctly and that someone would probably have to manually review it. He said that they have everything they need and for me to call back in a week if I do not see any progress and then to call back when my account hits 120 pays. 

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX and XXXX - Payments are still being reviewed XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing Spoke to an operator who said that my payments were supposed to begin on XX/XX/XXXX and because of that, all of my payments were outside of the payment window. I told her that I still had a copy of the administrative forbearance letter I received in XX/XX/XXXX that clearly states that my first payment would be on XX/XX/XXXX. She verified my first payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX, two weeks earlier than the actual due date. My account has been on direct draft ever since. I uploaded the copy of the administrative forbearance letter. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I uploaded my XXXX payment history that shows all of the missing payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX - I requested that my administrative forbearance document and XXXX payment history be emailed to a supervisor who works with reviewing payment. Operator said that she emailed a PSLF supervisor to request that my documents be reviewed. She said that usually people get a response within 7 days. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Called the Ombudsman. Talked to XXXX. Case number XXXXXXXX. Gave me the escalation phone number XXXX at MyFedLoan Servicing. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX with Ombudsman transferred me to the MyFedLoan escalation number. 

FedLoan Servicing XXXX - Will send in request to have my payment review expedited. A case worker will contact me. A caseworker will reach out to me via email in 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received an email from FedLoan Servicing - XXXX with Escalation. Said that my payments were under review. He said the XXXX payment that I was questioning was covered under the Cares Act. I responded and clarified that the payment that I am questioning was the XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX, payment that was covered under an administrative forbearance and told him that I uploaded verification of that on XX/XX/XXXX. I also told him I uploaded my complete XXXX financial activity statement that covers all of the months that are not being reflected on my FedLoan Servicing account dashboard. 

XX/XX/XXXX - FedLoan Servicing XXXX - Said that my account was still under review. Offered no time frame for completion. He said that it could take up to a year. Said that I would be notified when the review was completed. He said that it was an all or nothing situation. 

XXXX @ Ombudsman said that she would escalate my case so that I could have a specific agent assigned to me that is familiar with PSLF. Will be assigned a caseworker who is an ombudsman at FedLoan Servicing. Will contact me within 15 days to let me know what they need.

XXXX, IL XXXX XXXX From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX Attention : CFPB Hello CFPB, The purpose of this letter is to reemphasize those issues XXXX Salle Mae could have prevented it this scammed, fraud, coerced approach and allowed them with this issue in any way that they can. I just dont understand why did they have allowed it instead of preventing it? 
I want to mention that forbearance is bad because interest continues to accrue and will be capitalized, digging me into a deeper hole. I hope you truthfully find the following letter helpful that there's a reason for this, there's a reason XXXX education XXXX, and it's the same reason I brought this issue to your attention as it was never ever, ever was fixed. It's never going to get any better unless we all tackle the root of the problem together and Im delighted youre doing it as we speak. 
In Addition, it makes me feel helpless when I look at the student loan balance of more than {$160000.00} from {$25000.00} XXXX XXXX. XXXX, Salle Mae forced, intimidated, threaten me and make me defaulted many times. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have come under scrutiny for their high costs and poor outcomes many times. My position with this issue has not altered. It could have been prevented by XXXX, Salle-Mae and now Navient. It looks like to me for many years XXXX, Salle Mae and now Navient don't care or just ignoring, neglecting and undermine this issue instead of preventing it. 
They ( Citi-bank, Salle-Mae and now Navient ) know that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX target a person like me by offering an empty promise and higher education as part of the American middle class dream. XXXX, Salle Mae could have prevented it this scammed, fraud, coerced approach and allowed them with this issue in any way that they can. 
Instead was postponed the loan payments, causing the balance to quarto tripled grow even more, would be happy to help resolve and could have prevented it, but it has ballooned to more than {$150000.00} thousands of dollars. Why did they have allowed it instead of preventing it? 
I've witnessed the whole debt structure is rigged to make sure never going to get out of it. Also, I've enclosed other attached document for your review. 
Since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has bad reputation, credibility, FRAUD, SCAM regarding loans totals or Interest rates, they should payback to citi-bank, Salle-Mae and now Navient directly. Navient In conclusion I believe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and financial aid center are directly responsible in conjunction with XXXX, Salle Mae and now Navient the servicer {$150000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX thousands ) for the misrepresentation, misinformation, misleading knowingly and damage they inflicted on me mentally and physically and for that matter I should be forgiven. Because of negligence, misrepresentation, misinformation and bad treatment. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX could have prevented it so do XXXX, Salle Mae and now Navient. XXXX was seen as one of the worst for-profit school chains before it went out of business many years ago. 
XXXX, Salle Mae and now Navient could have been prevented it and solve this issue long time ago. Theyve been aware of all this issues for years. I think their position on this issue should change without being bias and unconditionally. 

I am truly and objectively responding to the curriculums were developed largely by a private individuals and small company that makes materials for workshop companies and motivational speakers for that invalid debt. The school was run largely by greedy selfish people ( middle management who were making XXXX plus a year ) with motivational speaking, sick people with backgrounds who were compensated based on how many people they persuaded to buy additional workshop, classes in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Financial aid center. Also, when I was there by their coerced approach to visit XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Financial aid Center, they were driving XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and etc. etc. cars but saw me at that time eating two meals most of the time miss meal a day. They should be accountable for this invalid debt. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Financial aid center were telling lies. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were taking advantage of XXXX, Sallie mae and Navient Bank who made these student loans were irresponsible for this invalid debt to begin with it is also their fault that they were making loans to me believing I will obtain employment in a given career to pay for this invalid debt and notes ( fake paperwork ). I was lied and misrepresented by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was a major for-profit school until its collapse many years ago. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) financial aid office faked my signature until I realized it later. I was shocked and learnt for the first time when I realized what XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX faked my signature to obtain money from XXXX XXXX, Sallie Mai and Navient now the servicer. I was an innocent person and victimized by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Secondly, I would like you to realize and understand that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was seen as one of the worst for-profit school chains before it went out of business many years ago. XXXX XXXX, Sallie Mae, Navients parent company doesn't know and understood what's going on behind the scene what XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX had done. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Financial aid center were putting out bad debt where those lenders took bad risks, where they are also to blame. I believe that they have to be accountable for this reason I'm not please by their misrepresentation and coerced approach. 
In conclusion I believe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Financial aid center are directly responsible to pay-back Navient the servicer {$150.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) for the misrepresentation and damage they inflicted on me and I should be forgiven. Because of negligence, misrepresentation and fake treatment, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was seen as one of the worst for-profit school chains before it went out of business many years ago. Im asking kindly to consider a resolution on this matter soon. I never thought Id be in this situation at my age. Here in I hoping to raise my family in a better future with opportunities and fulfilling dreams. But all I have gotten is misrepresented, cheated by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX coerced approach. 
Very truly, XXXX, XXXX Please see some facts about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX was suspended from XXXX 'XXXX  student loan program after a large number of its students misreported their income. XXXX was reinstated after paying fines of C {$1.00} XXXX and putting up a bond of C {$2.00} million. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and another graduate of one of XXXX XXXX XXXX Chicago-area campuses filed a class-action lawsuit accusing XXXX  of widespread deception, unlawful business practices and false advertising and alleging that students were not being prepared for high-tech jobs. The lawsuit contributed to a 20 % slide in the company 's stock. The class was not certified and the case was resolved for less than {$25000.00} in XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX a graduate of one of XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX-area campuses, filed a class-action complaint against XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Inc. on behalf of students in the post-baccalaureate degree program in XXXX XXXX. The suit alleged that the nature of the program was misrepresented by the advertising. The lawsuit was dismissed and refiled. During the first quarter of XXXX, a new complaint was filed in the same court by XXXX XXXX with the same general allegations. This action was stayed pending the outcome of the XXXX lawsuit. The lawsuits were being settled in late XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, the State of New York settled with three schools that were participating in questionable student-loan practices. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX were involved with the settlement. XXXX agreed to refund {$88000.00} to students. In XXXX, XXXX was accused of filing false claims and statements about recruitment pay and performance to the government. In XX/XX/XXXX, a lawsuit was filed by a former manager at XXXX which alleged that the college bribed students for positive performance reviews and worked around federal regulations on for-profit colleges. In XX/XX/XXXX, the attorney generals of Illinois and Massachusetts issued subpoenas to XXXX to investigate for violations of federal law and filing false information about loans, grants, and guarantees. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stated that the New York state attorney general 's office was investigating if the company 's marketing violated laws against false advertising. Senator XXXX XXXX 's report on the for-profit college industry revealed that XXXX 's tuition for an associate degree is 10 times higher than at community colleges ; it has a dropout rate of 50 percent ( 60 percent for online students ) within a median of 3 1/2 months ; spending per student of less than {$3000.00} per year on education, about a quarter of what is spent by the XXXX  of Illinois ; a CEO salary of {$6.00} XXXX, 46 times more than the president of the XXXX XXXX XXXX ; and evidence of deceptive recruiting of students. Two state attorneys general, Illinois and Massachusetts, are investigating XXXX. 
Misleading borrowers The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says that Navient illegally fail [ ed ] borrowers at every stage of repayment. The lawsuit, brought on by the CFPB, alleges that Navient hurt borrowers by providing bad and sometimes false information, not processing payments correctly and not taking appropriate steps to rectify situations when borrowers brought up these complaints. 
In fact, the lawsuit alleges that Navient purposely made many borrowers pay more on their loans than they needed to, and the CFPB is suing for borrowers to get financial relief from Navients mishandling. 
The suit alleges that Navient steered borrowers into forbearance over other options, like income-driven repayment plans. Forbearance temporarily pauses student loan payments without hurting your repayment standing, but interest still builds while youre not making payments. That means borrowers ended up paying more in interest because they went through with forbearance rather than saving money and choosing an IDR plan.

05/12/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Denied loan,"This all began with what I assume is a common problem for a lot of Americans. My wife and I were venturing into buying our first home or at least beginning the process. In order to begin looking at some open houses, we were advised to get a pre-approval letter. So, we reached out to a recommended mortgage lender and began the process. That's when we were told that our back-end debt-to-income ratio was currently just a few points higher than their underwriters would need for approval ( of the amount we were looking to spend on our first home ). This kickstarted my interest in helping my family out by delving into our finances and becoming a budgeting pro. I looked at our student loan situation and looked at where we could save some money. At this time, my wife and I have a small amount of consumer debt ( generally paid off monthly ), one credit card with a 6.24 % interest rate on a balance transfer that we're aggressively paying off, no car payments, no consumer loans, and a decent amount in savings - hopefully for a down-payment. My wife, a XXXX XXXX XXXX, spent quite a bit of loan money on her education, thus making our monthly student loan repayment obligations fairly high. There are 4 private loans with a private bank, Citizens Bank, being serviced by XXXX. I reached out to Citizens and explored their Education Refinance program. Seeing as how the 4 loans I was hoping to have consolidated/refinanced are already with Citizens, I figured this would be an easy process. I was wrong. Because both my wife 's and my federal student loans were in National Emergency Forbearance, due to the recent relief bills passed in Congress, Citizens was unable to determine how much our monthly payments were on those loans and estimated that payment to be higher. So, I then opted out of the forbearance and reinstated the federal student loan payments to create a record of what our income-based repayment amount is monthly, for both of our loans. I was then also told that the refinance application with Citizens also listed our rent payment twice ; once as rent payment and once as a mortgage payment. Once they fixed that on their end we were told that we still did not qualify. My wife makes a decent, stable, living as a XXXX XXXX  - serving the mental health community at a local non-profit hospital. Not only will her federal student loans be forgiven in a few more years, he current monthly payment - combined with our other debts - shows a relatively low debt-to-income ratio. First, we were told that they strictly look at our debt-to-income ratio, full stop. Then, in the same conversation, I was told that it was more of a holistic view of the applicant. Which is it then? We were told by Citizens that everyone who applies goes through a qualification process that takes into account their job, their education, their income, and their debts, in order to determine what DTI will be assigned to them. Other than that, they said that their process and that DTI was proprietary and that they were unable to share more with us about their process. Which really put up a red flag. Because we currently pay Citizens Bank for the loans we're wishing to refinance. And, if we refinance, then we'll be paying less monthly for them. Also, another representative told me that the decision has nothing to do with our creditworthiness, but that it had to do with our debt obligations ( which contain the loans we want to refinance ). In the weeks leading up to this complaint, I did a lot of homework at their request, including sending them scanned copies of our tax returns from XXXX and XXXX, along with all of the corroborating documents for those returns ( W-2 's, 1099 's, etc. ). I also sent a letter to the Attorney General 's office in Massachusetts, Senators XXXX, and XXXX, along with Congressman XXXX. Someone from the AG 's office did get back to me and is helping us look into this further. As of today, another representative at Citizens mentioned that our case has been elevated to the Office of the Chairman, where I hope someone will look at us as customers, with ample qualification, and overturn that denial. This process has been going on for over 6 weeks and I believe that Citizens will now try to hide behind their "" Policies '' and "" trade secrets '' in an effort to hold us off at the pass. But, I won't stand for it. I believe that Citizens is not looking at all of the documentation and evidence we have supplied and taken into account our determination to make financially sound decisions for our family going forward. I believe they are using a metric, told to me by their representative, of calculating our federal student loan monthly payments by multiplying our outstanding federal student loans by 1.8 % to determine our monthly outlay. Far more than the XXXX XXXX ( 0.5 % ) and XXXX XXXX ( 1.0 % ) calculation that is commonly used by mortgage lenders and alike. Which is a grossly miscalculated and inflated number, even if our federal student loans were in standard repayment. It would be impossible for us to meet that obligation and those numbers they calculated are false. What we do have going for us is that I've done an incredible amount of legwork to have all of our numbers, credit reports, and alike, at my fingertips to support my case. Had this just have been another year I might have called it quits weeks ago. But, after conversing with multiple Citizens representatives and teasing out a few pieces of their proprietary puzzle, I feel the only missing pieces are soon to be revealed.

I have an old non PDF statement of account that is VERY different from what the company is now showing. I can have this scanned if needed but anyone with eyes can see what I'm saying without looking at it as the report is very sketchy. 
In XXXX I graduated law school and I would happily return the degree if possible. It's worthless. 
XXXX XXXX spent years convincing me to do things that weren't smart. In XXXX it turned to threats. I said do it so they destroyed my credit. 
In XXXX I had a lawyer draft what I wanted ... a payment schedule that fit with what I could afford on a teacher salary. 
I started paying the agreement and never missed one after. 
However in XXXX they changed handlers. 
I received court notices they were going to sue. 
I spoke and showed every payment and they dropped the charges. 
Now in XXXX I wanted a statement of account. 
In XXXX my XXXX loan was down to XXXX in the paper. I will go through my papers if I need to and get it scanned. 
So I filed a complaint and Navient first provided a statement that they suddenly had all my 10 years of payment. 
I then filed a second complaint wondering why my loans were never changing. 
Now today I received a statement and it's conveniently stating all payments I have made for a decade are entirely in the interest and fees column. This is not what I was told 6 years ago. And for 10 years the balance didn't change at all. 
It doesn't smell honest at all if final bills don't change in a decade of payment. I'd like clarification, especially on the XXXX bill that was down to XXXX in XXXX is now being reported as XXXX back then.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NC,28590,None,Consent provided,Web,04/27/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4330928

06/09/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"I have two issues with StudentAid.Gov backed Parent Plus Loans for two dependents at three Universities, covering 9 loans ( unconsolidated ) - 1 ) I can not get information from the Loan Servicer ( XXXX XXXX & Nelnet ) even after engaging the StudentAid.gov Ombudsmen 2 ) Each company, reported derogatory no-payment on loan during the Forbearance Period and 3 ) accrual of interest on the loans after : a ) making more than 30 payments in a 17 month period totaling over {$9000.00} and b ) completing a Rehabilitation Loan Agreement negotiation and execution during the Forbearance Period.

XX/XX/XXXX started making $ XXXX/week payments on defaulted loan to.XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX started negotiation of Rehabilitation Agreement XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX accepted the Agreement and credited to the 9 month requirements payments from XX/XX/XXXXand Ending in XX/XX/XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX, I asked XXXX XXXX to show how the payments had been applied to the loans. XXXX XXXX did not respond to XXXX  letter and XXXX  follow-up request.XX/XX/XXXX, StudentAid.gov contacted me and said Nelnet was the new servicer of the loan having successfully completed the Rehabilitation Loan Agreement.

XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet contacted me tell me that I needed to declare a new repayment option by XX/XX/XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Nelnet by letter and by on-line account encrypted email system to ask if the XX/XX/XXXXdate was relevant during the forbearance period. I also asked Nelnet to show how the payments were applied to the loans, in a statement form. Nelnet has refused to answer either question. In same letter I asked a new question, to please show the loan origination and principle applications.

To be sure, Nelnet is avoiding answering these questions which I have asked them to do so in-writing for two reasons. One, I am not able to record phone conversations and they are not able to share the phone recordings with me. Two, Nelnet confirms in writing that it will not answer any questions in writing or respond to written requests.

XX/XX/XXXX, I turned these issues over to the StudentAid.gov Ombudsmen. I have not received a response from the Ombudsmen office but did from Nelnet asking me to contact them by phone. I have responded in the encrypted email system that I am awaiting written responses since I can not record the calls and they will not share the recordings. Please note, the encrypted email message threads are deleted by Nelnet within 5 days of their note and my responses. For that, I was thoughtful enough to do screen grabs of the threads.

XX/XX/XXXX, I have been notified by my credit card company that I have significant derogatory notes of missed payments to StudentAid.gov, made by the collection firm XXXX XXXX and then Nelnet for each month during the forbearnance period AND that the balances are accruing interest. I have obtained copies of the credit agency reports by both firms and for each month, there is a missed payment notification and an increasing balance on the loans. The credit card companies are worried and where I live in Colorado, Insurance companies and Employers use this data to qualify and provide pricing on insurance and job change approvals. I am very concerned about these two issues and less about their violation of the Forbearance Period issues.

02/07/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"This is in regards to a student loan with Discover Bank. In XXXX, my co-signer filed chapter XXXX bankruptcy, putting this loan in default. I contacted Discover and learned how I could continue to make on time payments on the loan in good faith and in order to decrease the balance. The bankruptcy cleared in XXXX, and I contacted Discover to learn how I could pay the remaining balance of {$860.00} before it was sent to collections. I was advised where to mail payment. I requested something in writing stating that this payment would satisfy full payment of the loan. I was told that this was not possible, but that the account would be updated if I mailed payment. I promptly mailed a check, along with a letter requesting that someone send me documentation upon receipt confirming that this was payment in full. They cashed the check in XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached photo ) but they never sent me documentation of payment in full. I contacted them several times about this and was assured it would be taken care of. I continued to wait for documentation, only to find that after cashing my check for the balance, they reported the account as being in collections on my credit report and that there was an outstanding balance of {$860.00}. My credit took a substantial hit. No one in customer service could explain this or correct it. I was promised calls back after looking into things, and these calls never came. 

After all this, and 5 months later in XXXX of XXXX, they mailed me back a check for the {$860.00}. They never corrected my credit report. I contacted them again on several occasions and was instructed to reach out to someone named XXXX XXXX. I did so and she never returned my calls or emails sent on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I did confirm with another Discover customer service rep named XXXX that the contact information was correct. I called and spoke with them more times than I care to count to resolve this, and no one could explain to me what the problem was or why they paid me back. They told me to mail another check, and I said I would do this if they could first a ) tell me what went wrong and the first time and b ) send me something in writing saying that payment of this amount would cover the balance in full and c ) fix their reporting to the credit bureau. They never did any of this, and I simply waited for the account to fall off my report, and took the hit to my credit. I again contacted Discover in XXXX of XXXX asking for documentation that I could pay the remaining balance and be done with this debt, but the customer service representative requested additional days to look into the issue, and never called me back. 

In XXXX of this year, XXXX, I was contacted by a collection agency for the balance of XXXX on behalf of Discover. I was concerned that paying this would reopen the account on my credit report, but certainly did not and do not trust anyone at Discover to give me a straight or accurate answer about this, as they so grievously misdirected me up to this point. I paid the collection agency the full balance promptly, in hopes that this will finally resolve what has been a very frustrating and unfortunate experience. I received legal advice to file this complaint in order to avoid any further damage to my credit. I will never bank with Discover for any purpose again for this reason, and hope that this might help someone else in a similar predicament.",None,DISCOVER BANK,MD,21403,None,Consent provided,Web,02/07/21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4122933

After a few months ofattending this XXXX school I came down with the flu, at the time I lived in New Jersey and I use totake the bus to go to school. My travel would take about 2 hours to get to school. When I got sick I called the school and explain that I was very sick with the flu, that I won't be ableto attendschool for a few days. And she told mesince I had the flu it would be best to come back to school when I got better. 
After about 2 weeks I felt much better and went back to school and they told me I could not go back to class because I had missed toomany days. And I explain thatthe reason I did not come to school is that I had the flu, I also told them that I had spoken to XXXX the office manager and she said it was fine to come back when I got better. 
I askto speak toXXXX and they said she was out sick also. And I ask was there someone else I can speak to about this and they said no, that she was the person that was in charge of attendance and call back in a few days. When I called back they said she was out sick. Waited a few more weeks and called again and then they told me she had a transfer to another department that I needed to talk to XXXX and he was assigned to my case.And he would get back to me with a response about megetting back to class. Again I waited for a few more weeks for aresponse. Never got a call back from XXXX. I called back again and try to talk to XXXX and they told me he was not available that he would contact me. Months pass andI try to call and speak to XXXX and I was not able to speak to anyone about getting back to school.I was veryupset andfrustrated, that I could not do anything or talk to anyone about getting back to school. Months pass I try again to speak to XXXX and with no luck once again he was not available. Several months pass always try to speak to someone that could resolve this problem and was not able to speak to no one.Over a year had passed then I started receiving bills to start paying my student loan, I was surprised I was receiving this even though I had not finished as promised by the school.So I called the school again and try to speak to anyone that could help me resolve this issue or answer my questions, as to why I was being charged for a student loan bill when I was not let back to school to finish my classes. I even ask for XXXX and they told me he was not available. A few months pass started making my payments to XXXX XXXX and I called them and explain my situation and they told me I should contact the school or go in person and get the problem resolve. So I went in person and try to speak to anyone and to my surprise, the school had closed in XXXX So I called XXXX XXXX and they told me to apply for an Economic hardship deferment request and at the time I was not working so they told to apply for an Unemployment Deferment and to also apply for a Loan Discharge Application since I was not let back to finish my classes.And XXXX XXXX told me to keep paying my student loan as best as I could in the meantime while the applications went through because if I did not it would mess up my credit. I apply several times for these applications throughout these years and I never received a response. After a few years of dealing with XXXX XXXX and no solution to my problem, I received a letter saying that my loan had been acquired by Sallie Mae, so I started calling and speaking to Sallie Mae representatives and I explain the problem that I had with my student loan and they also ask me to sent a Loan Discharge, Economic Hardship, and I did a few times and no solution either. After a few more years, I received another letter saying that my loan had been acquired by Navient and I also called them and explain the problem with my student loan and they took my number and I never received a call from anybody. The original company that I was paying to was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and then Sallie Mae Loan Services and now Navient. I also contacted XXXX XXXX to see if they can help me fix this problem with my student loan with The U.S. Department of Education. And my claim to get my student loan discharged was decline. I checked my records the original loan was for $ XXXX these past years. I paid to the different companies that had my student loan about {$10.00} And now I just checked my credit and is showing 2 student loans when I only had one. This is why I think I should not be responsible to pay any more money to a student loan that Im being forced to pay, and that the school took the money and ran and never let me finished my classes to get my diploma.

02/17/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"XX/XX/XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I would like to file a complaint against Access Group and XXXX XXXX. I have filed previous complaints regarding this matter on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). My complaints are regarding my private student loans,. I have endured great hardship due to the COVID 19 pandemic and I am currently receiving COVID 19 unemployment and disaster aid. I have repeatedly requested that Access Group offer an Income Based Repayment Plan for these private loans. They have ignored all requests and refuse to offer alternative payment options. My private loans have been taken out of pandemic deferment and have a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I need for Access Group to offer an alternative IRB plan. I will not be able to pay these loans back if they refuse to work with me on the loans. Here is a copy of the letter that I have sent to them today : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Dear Access Group and XXXX XXXX, I received the mailed statement that my private loans were going back into payment beginning XX/XX/XXXX. The loans have been in a COVID 19 pandemic deferment. My small business has been financially damaged due to COVID-19. I lost more than 75 % of my income. I am currently being supported with unemployment pandemic disaster aid and I can not afford to pay this bill at this time. 

My situation has not changed since I last notified you of my financial situation. In fact, my situation is now much worse. My XXXX has suffered greatly because of the COVID 19 pandemic, a destructive president who was impeached twice who caused a massive insurrection on the XXXX XXXX and now my area is buried in snow with deadly freezing temperatures, and experiencing power outages and loss of internet. There is really nothing I can do. I feel like giving up. 

Far more damaging than COVID 19 has been the crazy, hateful rhetoric, lies, conspiracy theories and the attempt to overthrow our democracy by Trump that has caused great instability for people in all areas of our lives. It has been so extremely hurtful and has caused so much damage and sadness. I dont know how this nation and its people will heal from all of the destruction. 

Small businesses like mine have been destroyed and no one has worked harder than I have to build their business. I blame my government for my inability to pay back these student loans, for ruining my life starting with the financial market crash in XXXX and then the lack of any ability to lead during the COVID 19 pandemic devastating our country and economy and then the final assault on our XXXX XXXX. 

How much can we take? Seriously, how do you expect me to overcome this? I honestly dont think I can. I am single and have endured too many disasters that it has become impossible. These national disasters were not my fault. 


It is beyond comprehension what we have just been through! It has been so damaging to have such a narcissistic president who cared nothing about us and how damaging his crazy hateful behavior was on our lives. 

I am financially unable to pay the statements sent for my private student loans. I dont foresee that I will be able to pay them this year. I would appreciate an income based repayment ( IBR ) plan option for my private student loans as otherwise I dont think that I will be able to pay you any amount if you can not work with me on the payments. 


Please contact me to confirm you have received my letter. 
Thank you, -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- It is very unacceptable that my government has allowed for lenders to continue to treat private student loans differently than other student loans. These are student loans and it is very unfair! As I said in my letter to Access Group and XXXX XXXX, I blame my government for my inability to pay back my student loans.

03/29/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WV XXXX XXXX SSN XXXX To Whom It Concerns, I have received communication from the IRS that Conduent Education Services submitted a form 1099C for me in XXXX. Although I have had issues with student loans since the XXXX I have never had any business dealings with Conduent Education Services. 

My student loan issues ( whoever services these as it seemed to change quite often ) could never provide any of the following : The Promissory Notes from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. ( Note that one year I did not have a student loan, but it was a long time ago and Im not sure if it was XXXX or XXXX ). I need this because it shows interest rates etc. 

Transcript of all payments made on the loans which I started repaying in XXXX. Just so you know, the bank could never supply this They never took any legal action to collect the amount they said was outstanding because they did not have the documents and I had paid the loans off. 

I only borrowed {$12000.00}. I paid on it for years with a low interest rate, as you will see if you find the documents. Because I sat out of school for a year it was set up as two loans. I paid on both but they continuous made mistakes and applied all the money to one loan. Then would contact me stating one or the other loan was going to default because all the payments were applied to the other loan instead of to both. I would have to contact them every time and get it straightened out.

Eventually, I grew tired of the hassle and said give me a payoff and I will just pay both loans in full. They sent me a payoff amount which was as much as I had originally borrowed. I had paid timely for over 8 years on a XXXX loan. Constantly I contacted them trying to work this out. I requested transcripts of the account just to be told that they only have that for 1 year. 

Around XXXX, I sat had any outstanding balance calculated independently based on the information I had and sent them a cashiers check for the balance marked with both account numbers PAID IN FULL. 

I would check my Credit Reporting and find it was on my credit report every few years. I would report it the credit reporting agency and it would drop off again. Finally, in XXXX, I found it on credit again and demanded it be removed. I was told by whoever put it on there that this time it was resolved. 
Relieved to finally resolve the issue, I disposed of these records during my last move in XXXX as far as I recall. 

It appears that Conduent Education Services with whom I never had any prior dealings, submitted a XXXX for {$10000.00} for XXXX to the IRS. Implying this was a forgiven debt with tax consequences. It was not. I did not owe this money. I did not receive the 1099 as it was not mailed to my current address. 

This is not a loan that was forgiven and should have tax consequences. This was a loan that the bank screwed up and could not account for my payments and has an erroneous principal amount. 

Here is the only information I have : Conduent Education Services XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX Account Information XXXX Form XXXX C {$10000.00} My research of Conduent Education Services shows it was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. I am unable to contact Conduent Education Services at address given on the 1099 to resolve my potential tax issues with the IRS. 

This issue is so very old I do not know any of the following : who was the business that I talked to in XXXX? Where did I bank when I was making payments in the XXXX and XXXX? It is ridiculous to assume I would have records from 30 years ago. I have done my best at every turn to deal with this issue as timely as humanly possible. Even 30 years ago, this issue was very important to me not only for the credit implications but because defaulting a debt would endanger my employment with the IRS as it is against our code of Ethics. 

My research of Conduent Education Services also revealed that it was previously knows as Affiliated Computer Services ( ACS ) and had a contract with the Department of Education to service federal student loans. 

In XXXX and XXXX, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigated ACS. Some student loans werent properly updated and had incorrect principal balances. 

This is the exact issue I was raising with the administrator of my student loans since the late XXXX. I paid on time for years and the principal was never reduced, and no explanation could ever be given. There were no late fees etc. 

At their direction of IRS, I wrote to Conduent Education Services at the address given. It came back as Not Known at Address ; Unable to Forward.

Now the IRS has sent me a 90 Day Proposed Assessment Notice for this 1099.

I have had to deal with the credit implications and aggravations of this for years ( since the late XXXX ) and now it has been turned in as a 1099 which affects my tax liabilities.

Not only does this result in a tax balance that I do not owe and should not have to pay, I work for the IRS and having an increase in taxes that I did not put on my original tax return will result in disciplinary actions against me. Also having a report of a forgiveness of debt on that 1099 will result in disciplinary action against me.

There is great harm to me by Conduent Education Services financially, professionally, and emotionally.

I need this 1099 recalled by Conduent Education Services immediately. 

I would also like a case summary of the XXXX and/or XXXX case ( s ) against ACS to support my issues with the Internal Revenue Service. 

I greatly appreciate your time and assistance in resolving this",None,ACS Education Services,WV,26201,None,Consent provided,Web,03/29/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4253700

05/18/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"My wife and I borrowed money for college from the years XXXX. We both had Stafford loans and shortly after we got married in XXXX we began making payments on our student loans. At the time, it was "" XXXX '' that serviced our Stafford Loans. Unbeknownst to us at that time, as young and inexperienced borrowers, we decided to consolidate our student loans together at 6.875 % and begin paying on them together. 

Well, it wasn't long after that that we realized we didn't have the money every month to make the payments we were required to pay and so we put our loans in deferment. Due to circumstances out of our control in the following years, we still were unable to pay on our student loans and we ended up putting them into forbearance not realizing that our loan balances were continuing to have interest appreciate on those balances. 

About ten years ago, Sallie Mae was taken over by Navient and we were told to put our loans in forbearance again. But by then, we had already accrued a ton of interest on our loans. We finally went into an XXXX plan while our loan continued to accrue interest and we made very minimal payments on the loans. The amounts we were paying were simply paying interest and we had no hope of any of that money every going towards any principal. 

Fast forward to XXXX where we are still making payments on these loans with no hope of ever paying off the balances. Navient has done nothing to help us figure out if there are other options to determine how we can ever pay these loans off. Our income is slowly starting to grow as my wife and I have had new jobs and we are watching our IBR payments continue to rise while none of these payments go to help us pay off any principal. 

Over the years, we have been pushed into forbearance before being given the option of IBRepayment, thus accruing ridiculous amounts of interest onto our principal balance and now, {$45000.00} worth of original student loans has grown to over {$94000.00} of repayment. Interest accrues daily and we still are watching our loan balance climb with no way of making a dent in the principal. 

If there is any way we can get some relief from this growing mountain of debt that just continues to grow ... we would be grateful. Navient has simply taken advantage of people like us in a needy situation and profited off of us.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",TN,37128,None,Consent provided,Web,05/18/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4386578

04/21/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"New Complaint : Repayment Plan reflects Extended Repayment Plan-Principal and Interest I've been paying my Standard Repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I signed up for the Navient 's Rate reduction Program in XXXX and their Customer Service Rep ( CSR ) Supervisor just informed me today that under the Rate Reduction Program, the CSR has the option to reduce your payment for a selected timeframe or extend the term duration on the loan in order to get the payment lower. I was informed that in order to refinance my loan to get a lower payment, I would have to refinance my loan with another lender since Navient does not offer refinancing options on Private Student loans. Now as a consumer, it appears that my loan was negligently managed by Navient and I may be stuck with paying for their mistake. I've asked about refinancing my loan and I was informed that those options are not available for Private Student Loans. Now, I need clarity on if you currently don't offer those services on Private Student Loans, how can you extend the Repayment terms? I was informed that their are programs that Navient offer for financial hardships and the Rate Reduction Program is what I was introduced too. 

At the time of enrolling into the Rate Reduction Program, the CSR is required to inform the consumer that the term will be extended but I only agreed to the Rate Reduction Program and not an extension of my Contract Repayment terms. I explained to the supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX, I only agreed to the Rate Reduction Program to lower my payment for a period of time and not to extend the term of my loan. I explained to the supervisor that I am requesting the call to from XXXX to be pulled to validate that I agreed to the Extended Repayment Plan. 

I asked the supervisor if an error is found that Navient extended my terms without my consent, will they reduce the remaining terms and dissolve the increase in my payment? The supervisor stated, "" Your payment would be increased and you would be responsible for paying the increase. '' That is unfair to a consumer who was deceived about the pretenses of a program for financial hardships. 

The supervisor agreed to have the call reviewed and provide a response back within the next 7 days but I want to file a complaint as a formality to get a documented resolution. I am requesting my terms to be reduced and any overages due to miscalculations be dissolved due to Navient 's error. 









Initial Complaint : XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a {$12000.00} student loan in XXXX to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ga with XXXX. When I signed for this student loan, I wasnt told that this was credit base and that there was d/ifferent stipulations but that it was a federal student loan to help cover school expenses. On XX/XX/XXXX, it was transferred to Navient. I have been repaying this loan since XX/XX/XXXX without any breaks in payments and due to this variable interest rate, it has become challenging to pay this loan off. I cant refinance the loan because of my credit and I'm exhausted of attempts to refinance my loan to get a fixed rate. The balance of my loan is over $ XXXX and if I have been paying on this loan since XXXX, the loan should not still be astronomical if it originated at $ XXXX. My loan has accrued at least $ XXXX of interest and it still increasing. I have spoke with Navient about forgiving my loan but there are no alternatives. I asked about forgiveness of my loan, refinancing my loan for a fixed rate and I was educated that there is no loan forgiveness for private loans and that Navient doesn't offer refinancing options for Private loans. If I was educated back in XXXX, I would have never signed for this loan. So I'm out of options. I need some help on refinancing my private loan and I need my account researched to see if the interest was calculated accurately. I feel that my balance should be lower than it's current amount. Since I left XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA, I have accomplished two ( 2 ) XXXX, one ( 1 ) XXXX and two ( 2 ) XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. I have accumulated over $ XXXX in student loans just to find an eligible job that will pay a decent salary. I had to defer my {$1000.00} payments to pay down other debt just to have the ability to refinance my student loan and that is taking some time. So I need all the help.

Today I was told that they couldn't give me a date for it to be posted as these matters are handled in the order in which they are received. The customer service person told me this would not be reported to my credit or my daughter 's credit but when I asked for that in writing she said she could not provide that.

02/18/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My complaint is against XXXX XXXX XXXX, AES and FedLoan Servicing. I believe I should be granted PSLF ( or TEPSLF ) right now, with a refund for years of payments overpaid. I have made regular payments on my student loans since XXXX, and have been employed by a PSLF- eligible employer all these years. I have been on an income-based repayment program since XX/XX/XXXX. My loans are currently in an IBR/PSLF with FedLoan Servicing but they say I won't be eligible for forgiveness til XX/XX/XXXX. ( The paperwork actually says XX/XX/XXXX because the system is not "" counting '' the COVD-excused payments in paper correspondence though the customer service agents say that will be corrected ). At any rate, let me explain why I should be forgiven right now : I received my PhD in XXXX and began repaying my loans, which were over {$110000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to AES and set up on Direct Debit. Not long after the transfer, I talked to someone at AES to ask about IBR and PSLF, options I had not pursued before because I did not know about them til a colleague told me about it. The person at AES said "" sure! we can do that! '' I got set up for IBR around XX/XX/XXXX and thought I was good to go. 

I recertified for IBR every year and in XX/XX/XXXX I called just to check in about IBR and the PSLF. Much to my dismay I was then told that my 2 years of IBR payments were NOT counting toward PSLF because I had been given incorrect info by the AES loan person 2 years prior. ( I have since learned this was a common shady practice at the time so that lending companies would not see all their loans go away to different companies ). AES told me my loan was a FFELP and not a Direct Loan and that I could shift to a Direct Loan but I would lose those 2 years of payments ( not to mention all the payments since XXXX when the program started ). This was the first I had heard of any of this! At that point I did the only thing I could : I consolidated my FFELP to Direct Loans, which shifted my loans from AES to FedLoan Servicing, which is where they are now. I pay on time and certify for IBR and PSLF every year. ( Currently of course, I am not paying due to COVID relief, but those months are supposed to still "" count '' as if paid ). 

FedLoan servicing tells me every year ( because I ask every year ) that they can't count anything prior to XXXX because that's when my loans become Direct Loans and were shifted to them. They say my loans will be forgiven around XX/XX/XXXX. The principal of my loans, even after 20 years of payment, is still over $ XXXX despite the fact that all these loan payments have negatively impacted my family 's life and my ability to save or invest. ( XXXX XXXX at state universities don't get paid much ). So all those payments ( made with difficulty ) were just money down the toilet. Meanwhile, I have probably paid my debt twice over. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and need to save for retirement. I want this monkey off my back. So I ask for the following : 1. I want my loans forgiven now, under PSLF. 2. I want AES to be held accountable for the bad instructions they gave me in XX/XX/XXXX when I asked to get into the PSLF program -- instructions that cost me 2 years of payments, if not more. 3. I also want both XXXX XXXX and AES to be accountable for being negligent -- for not telling me that IBR and PSLF were options -- I should not have had to find that out on my own. 4. I want FedLoan Servicing to be accountable for the fact that ever since COVID relief has excused borrowers from paying, the date of forgiveness has not been accurate. forgiveness date on statements keeps moving forward, as if the COVID-forgiven payments don't count, when they do. This is very anxiety-producing and confusing. 

I hear that the government is now helping people like me who have been paying for many years into a loan that is in some way "" not the right kind of loan '' for PSLF. Please help me right this wrong and help me get my loans forgiven right now.",None,AES/PHEAA,NC,28605,None,Consent provided,Web,02/18/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4148091

The Navient customer service representative over the phone told me they would place the loan on deferment and I would not need to make a payment for 90 days. The customer service representative was inaccurate in the information they gave me as they FAILED to put the loans in deferral mode. 

Although I was clearly communicated to that there was no need to make a payment for the days outlined while I waited for consolidation to process, this misinformation caused there to become a failure to pay. With that being said, once I found out there was any sort of inquiry on this loan, I was forced to make an immediate payment but was still penalized for the inaccurate information the representative gave me.

I made multiple phone calls to ECSI, who could not tell me what was required and I submitted my tax information multiple times. The CARES ACT puts all federal student loans into deferrment, but I do not realize that these are not considered federal loans and they become past due. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached chat ) : Finally, after approximately 9 months, during a chat session ECSI informs me during a chat session that the reason that an income-driven repayment plan is being rejected is because the loans are not eligible for that payment plan at all. This is the first time this has been communicated with me. I retroactively put my loans into forbearance to protect my credit. I ask how to consolidate my loans, but they do not have this information. Given the stressors our hospital was facing during the height of the pandemic, I do not pursue this option further.

There have been problems throughout the entire term of the loans with respect to how payments have been calculated, but I have been employed with a qualifying employer for well over 120 payments at this point.

There was never any indication that one modality of submission would result in any difference in processing time. I still had no update through XX/XX/21 and contacted FedLoan Servicing again.

I had made 120 PSLF qualifying payments by XX/XX/XXXX. I therefore submitted my first Application for Forgiveness ( PSLF ) to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my payment counts were updated on the FedLoan website to reflect the 120 PSLF qualifying payments, and I was told by telephone by a FedLoan representative that my loans were then being forwarded to the Department of Education for final approval for forgiveness. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a forgiveness denial letter on the FedLoan website which stated as the reasoning, MISSING INFORMATION : Your employer certified the dates of employment that were entered in Section 3 of the application. However, the employment end date is before the employment begin date. This statement did not correlate with logic, as my employment begin date ( at my current employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was correctly listed as XX/XX/XXXX, and the checkbox for Still employed was correctly checked. I contacted both FedLoan Customer Service as well as the Ombudsman. I was told that this denial was an automatically generated message due to the fact that my forgiveness application had been in duplicate XXXX both faxed and uploaded ), and that my forgiveness was not denied and rather was still being reviewed and to continue waiting. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter was the last written correspondence from FedLoans until XX/XX/XXXX, at which time a Qualifying Payment Update was posted to my account, showing 121 PSLF qualifying payments and again stating eligibility for forgiveness, though still no statement on forgiveness application status nor notification of forgiveness. Contacting FedLoans by phone has resulted in no specific status update aside from in process or dropped phone calls. 

Yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I contacted the Office of Consumer Advocacy at the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ( PHEAA ) to enquire about my application, since it has been greater than 90 days since my application for PSLF forgiveness. I did receive a very timely reply today that they verified my application is being reviewed -- however, based on their email, despite that it has been over 3 months since my application for forgiveness, my application has not yet been forwarded from FedLoans to the Department of Education for final review and approval. They also stated that it may be an additional up to 6 months once forwarded before approval is granted, and that they could not specify a timeframe for any of the above.

To summarize, I have worked full-time for a nonprofit organization and made >120 payments ( 120 as of XXXX, which was over three months ago ) and have only had two employers during this timeframe ; I have submitted ECF forms regularly throughout this time to keep on top of my status toward PSLF and have followed all program rules and guidelines carefully. It has now already been over 3 months since my application, and it sounds like there is an undetermined amount of time still before my application will be forwarded to the Department of Education, then once there, it could still take up to 6 more months. Throughout this time, I must continue to work for the same employer to be able to receive forgiveness. I am unfortunately currently in a stressful work situation with discriminatory practices and concerns. I have fear of raising these concerns due to needing job security for this program. This time delay is taking a significant toll on my mental, and thus even downstream physical ( due to loss of sleep, fatigue ), health. I would like to at least change my job to another nonprofit organization, however I do not know if even that move would cause a problem with the PSLF forgiveness process, or if it would then have to start all over again. So, I am effectively stuck in my current position, with significant downstream effects on my well being, which also affects my family. 

I am asking for your assistance. Any help you can provide to expedite my PSLF forgiveness application being forwarded to the Dept of Education for final review, and a final determination of forgiveness after this already >3 month wait, would be very much appreciated.

05/16/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In XXXX, as a high school freshman, I knew one day I would be a college graduate. Born to parents who struggled financially, no college fund was established for me. Neither of my parents graduated from college, and were ill-equipped or knowledgeable regarding the financial expectations of attending university. If I attended college, I would be responsible for paying for it, and I would eventually use student loans to do so. 

Fast forwarding to XXXX, in a focused effort to improve my overall credit score, I have been working with a financial planner. After reviewing my debts, I was made aware of illicit practices regarding the distribution of payments for my student loan with Nelnet. The overall student loan has been broken into 6 groups, two of which have been paid off. 

* ( Dollar amounts are rounded down, and do not reflect change ) The details of the remaining groups are as follows : Group 1 ) The original loan amount was {$7700.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. The current outstanding balance is {$6000.00}. During the history of the loan, {$3300.00} has been paid, with {$2100.00} going to principal, {$1000.00} going towards interest, and {$100.00} going towards fees. The interest rate is 2.43 %, and the daily accrual is {$.00}. This group is categorized as a FFELP Subsidized Stafford Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 5-12 ] Group 2 ) The original loan amount was {$8500.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. The current outstanding balance is {$8600.00}. During the history of the loan, {$4300.00} has been paid, with {$2600.00} going to principal, {$1500.00} going towards interest, and {$120.00} going towards fees. The interest rate is 2.43 %, and the daily accrual is {$.00}. This group is categorized as a FFELP Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 12-19 ] Group 3 ) The original loan amount was {$6700.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. The current outstanding balance is {$7300.00}. During the history of the loan, {$3700.00} has been paid, with {$950.00} going to principal, {$2600.00} going towards interest, and {$120.00} going towards fees. The interest rate is 6.8 %, and the daily accrual is {$1.00}. This group is categorized as a FFELP Subsidized Stafford Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 19-26 ] Group 4 ) The original amount was {$1200.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. This loan group has been paid in full ; however, at the termination of the loan, the balance was {$1700.00}. During the history of the loan, {$2500.00} was paid, {$1900.00} going towards principal, {$560.00} going to interest, and {$24.00} going towards fees. The interest rate on this loan was 6.8 %, and the daily accrual was not documented in the historical information provided by Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. This group was categorized as a FFELP Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 26-32 ] Group 5 ) The original loan amount was {$18000.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. The current outstanding balance is {$14000.00}. During the history of the loan, {$5500.00} has been paid, with {$2300.00} going to principal, {$2900.00} going towards interest, and {$170.00} towards fees. The interest rate is 3.5 %, and the daily accrual is {$1.00}. This group is categorized as a FFELP Subsidized Consolidated Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 32-39 ] Group 6 ) The original amount was {$1700.00} issued on XX/XX/XXXX. This loan group has been paid in full. During the history of the loan, {$1300.00} was paid, {$1500.00} going towards principal, {$270.00} going to interest, and {$14.00} going towards fees. The interest rate on this loan was 3.5 %, and the daily accrual was {$.00}. This group was categorized as a FFELP Unsubsidized Consolidated Loan. [ See enclosed attachment : pages 2, 39-46 ] After reviewing my student loan history, I have several complaints I would like to register : 1 ) During the course of my student loan history, I have returned to school, and during my return, I am aware some of my loan groups acquired interest ; however, after I graduated, and returned to paying my student loans, there were on-time payments made and no money was applied to the principal of specific groups. All the money was applied to interest. In fact, some of the student loan groups have experience no principal impact after years of student loan repayments. Even though the repayment plan was later changed to a graduated extended repayment plan, money should have been applied to the principal. Even when an additional payment was made immediately after a regular on-time payment, money was still applied to interest. ( See enclosed attachment : page 45 and 46- Payment made to Group 6 ).

2 ) During the global pandemic beginning XX/XX/XXXX, student loan interest on federal student loans with FFELP were supposed to be suspended ( this was the case with my FFELP loans through Granite State Management Resources ) ; however, Nelnet never suspended the student loan interest. When I called to inquire about canceling the interest, they said these were not federal loans ; on the other hand, when I called in XXXX to negotiate the interest rate, I was told the interest rates are not negotiable because they are federal loans. 

3 ) During the XXXX school year, while working as a full-time teacher in a Title I school, I was denied the Teacher Loan Forgiveness, which according to a loan officer, XXXX, at Nelnet, I qualified. Since that time, thousands of dollars in interest have been accrued. When I inquired why my loan forgiveness was denied, they said because I had a student loan before XX/XX/XXXX ; however, none of my loans were issued before XXXX. 

Previous actions taken : I have reached out to Nelnet on multiple occasions to discuss the acrimonious practices regarding my student loans, and the bad faith and incongruent practices displayed by the company during the history of my student loans. 

It is truly frustrating when there are individuals who intentionally defer their student loan repayments and die still owing the debt ; however, a responsible citizen, like myself, who understands the concept of a promissory note, and repayments is repeatedly diverted to assuage my response.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",TN,37129,None,Consent provided,Web,05/16/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4381095

05/18/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have numerous and complicated issues with my student loans from law school. Allow me to preface all of this by stating that I attended law school expressly to become a public interest lawyer, which is exactly what I've done. I attended law school from the fall of XXXX through the spring of XXXX, which incidentally left me graduating right in the midst of the financial crisis. Moreover, I find this situation both humiliating and debilitating. I feel like a fool that I actually thought student loans were designed to help students, which is why I wasnt as aggressive, and didnt clearly document everything, with regards to these loans. I feel like an XXXX and like I got scammed. Additionally, and this applies to student loans as a whole, the practice of requiring interest only payments up front for all student borrowers makes it impossible to reduce the debt. This does not occur in any other borrowing situation, and frankly makes it such that I mightve been better off paying for college with a credit card. I have paid nearly {$70000.00} towards my student loans and have barely touched the ( incorrect ) principal. 

My issues are as follows : 1 ) The principal amount borrowed for my student loan is incorrect ; 2 ) I was essentially strong-armed into a consolidation prior to graduation under the false pretense of securing a lower interest rate ( the rate was more than double ) ; and finally, 3 ) Upon graduating, I was under the impression that I re-consolidated into a federal direct loan eligible for public interest forgiveness, but I was not. The website for my loan indicated ( up until recently, now it doesn't indicate loan type at all ) that I had direct loans eligible for forgiveness. It was not until around XXXX, by going into the federal aid portal, that I discovered that I was in the wrong loan type. Had the website indicated that it was a FFEL loan initially, I could have reconsolidated into the correct direct loan right away and corrected the problem. 

My desired outcomes are as follows : 1 ) I would like my principal to be adjusted and corrected, and to be credited for overpayment of interest based on the erroneous principal ; 2 ) I would like my interest rate to be properly adjusted to the rate I was in prior to being fraudulently deceived into a consolidation, and to be credited for the overpayments of interest based on the coercively obtained interest rate ; and most importantly, 3 ) I would like to be placed in the proper XXXX interest forgiveness loan, with either my original interest rate, or a current competitive interest rate, and for my years of payments to be applied to that loan. 

According to the lenders website, the principal for my non-subsidized Stafford loan was {$56000.00} ( originally {$52000.00} ) and for my subsidized Stafford loan was {$49000.00} ( originally {$50000.00} ). Because I was fully under the impression that I was consolidated in a public interest loan that would be forgiven, I was less than diligent in examining the details of these totals, which I deeply regret. However, consistent with both the AES ( Lender ) website and the studentaid.gov website, approximately {$10000.00} has been added to the total of the amount disbursed, and thereby to my principal. i am using round numbers in my math, but according to the AES site, As of the date of the first consolidation, or XX/XX/XXXX, the total amount disbursed to me was about {$60000.00} ( {$33000.00} subsidized/ {$28000.00} unsubsidized ). Likewise for the studentaid.gov website. Not only is that amount consistent with the amounts disbursed up until and including the disbursement dated XX/XX/XXXX, but it was also the total of the first consolidation loan, which corroborates that amount. Subsequent to the first consolidation, there were two disbursements of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans respectively. One disbursement on XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$9000.00} and one on XX/XX/XXXX for {$15000.00}. The total for both of these disbursements is {$24000.00}. If you add {$24000.00} to the prior total ( whether reviewing disbursements or based on the total of the previous consolidation ), the total is {$84000.00}. There was an interest charged totaling {$1400.00}, bringing the grand total as of my final disbursement to : {$86000.00}. 

Somehow, in the course of the first consolidation, approximately {$10000.00} is erroneously and fraudulently added to the total, and thereby to my principal. There is no record of such disbursement, nor was there any need for a dispersement. Likewise, no such dispersement appears on the studentaid.gov website. As such, interest was accrued on the unsubsidized portion of that fraudulent addition to the principal, and ultimately, that additional money was also incorporated into the second consolidation in XX/XX/XXXX. According to the second consolidation, there were dispersals in the amounts of {$17000.00} subsidized and {$16000.00} unsubsidized. This is not correct and is not consistent with the records of dispersement. The only dispersals made after the first consolidation were dated XX/XX/XXXX for {$4200.00} subsidized and {$5000.00} unsubsidized and XX/XX/XXXX for {$8500.00} subsidized and {$6900.00} unsubsidized, again for a total of {$24000.00}. Those are the only dispersals indicated on all of my records, are the only disbursements I received. Thus, based on that blatant fraud, the total principal for my second consolidation loan is improperly and illegally inflated. I have been paying interest on a bogus principal for more than ten years ( not including deferrals ). I demand that this total be corrected, and I be credited for all overpayment of interest on the sham principal. 

With regard to the first consolidation, and the interest rates generally. As of the spring of XXXX, the interest rate on all of my loans was 2.43 %. In the summer of XXXX, I attended classes and worked at a XXXX in XXXX XXXX. The lender should have been well aware of this, as they were providing financial aid. While I was on another continent, with a twelve hour time difference, very spotty if any internet connectivity, and no phone availability, the lender and financial aid department contacted my family and duplicitously and coercively claimed that I just had to consolidate my student loans within the next 30 days to lock in the lowest interest rate possible. With very little information, and no ability to research, which the lender knew, I agreed. I was not graduating until the next year, so there was absolutely no need to consolidate at that time. Moreover, and most importantly, the interest rate for the first consolidation loan was 4.62 %, almost twice my previous rate. This is price gouging and snake oil salesmanship at its best. Total scam. And I, naively, still thought students loans were designed to be pro-student. I am so stupid. I feel like I consolidated with the proverbial XXXX XXXX. Moreover, despite the interest rates being at historic lows in the XX/XX/XXXX due to the financial crisis, and despite my excellent credit rating, the interest rate for my second consolidation loan was even higher at 5.62 %. This is an outrage. My interest rate for the duration of all of the loans should be adjusted to the rate it was at before the fraud was perpetrated : 2.43 %, and any overpayment should be credited towards the principal. 

Finally, as I mentioned previously, I entered law school with every intention of going into public interest. My friends from orientation can attest to that. By the summer of XXXX, I had accepted a public interest position starting in XX/XX/XXXX as a law clerk in the XXXX Common Pleas Court. This clerkship paid approximately $ XXXX/year. Pursuant to my initial goal, I have remained in public interest for the duration of my career, working at the Disciplinary Board in XXXX, the U.S. Department of Labor from XXXX through XXXX, and the USPS from XXXX until present. As such, I was fully under the impression that my second consolidation in XX/XX/XXXX ( right in the midst of the bar exam, I might add ) was into the Federal Direct Public Interest Forgiveness Loan. This was a newer option at the time, but I one hundred percent believed that I had properly consolidated into the proper loan. Due to my meager salary as a clerk, I had no choice but to defer my loans until the beginning of XXXX. When I logged into my borrowers account to request the deferral in XXXX, the website clearly indicated the loan type as DIR, or Federal Direct, the type of consolidation loan used for Public Interest Loan Forgiveness ( PILF ). Likewise, when I resumed making payments, the account summary page continued to state DIR for the loan type. Accordingly, I continued to believe that I was under the PILF, that my income based repayments were being directed toward the PILF and that my balance after 10 years of payments would be forgiven. Had the website indicated a different loan type, or even if it had not indicated any loan type, this would have prompted me to do extensive research, determine the loan type, and if it were found to be incorrect, I could have refinance into a PILF Loan at any time without having wasted time and/or money making payments that did not apply. How do I know thats what I would have done because in approximately early XXXX, as I thought I was nearing the time to start worrying about PILF paperwork and also was looking to purchase a home, I checked the lenders website, and it now didnt indicate anything for the loan type. It was only at this time and by researching on the studentaid.gov website that I determined that I was somehow NOT in the proper loan, and rather somehow ended up in a FFEL loan. And moreover, that the FFEL loan was not even transferred back to the Department of Education like other FFEL loans were due to massive fraud. Great. I was so despondent and defeated that Ive been basically able to face this problem until now. I literally get nauseous whenever I even think about this horrible situation and the despicable conduct of the lender. Plus, I feel embarrassed and stupid for thinking this process was in any way for my benefit. Of course I should have been in a public interest loan. The lender knew that I was working in public interest from day one. They also knew that I had to defer paying my loan due to my meager public interest salary, which is priestly the reason for the PILF. And the fact that they mislabeled the loan is just insult on top of injury. Yes, I was a stupid XXXX to have any faith or trust in my lender, but I didnt deserve to be deceived and shouldnt have had to foresee that. The lenders dishonest and unscrupulous actions prevented my ability to foresee or correct any errors. I should be place din the proper loan consolidation and the income based repayments Ive been making for years should absolutely be applied to that consolidation. 

In short, I was robbed when the lender tried to slip in an extra {$10000.00} into my principal and the the lender extorted additional interest based on that theft. Then I was coerced and conned into a higher interest rate. And finally, I was deceived and intentionally defrauded from my ability to have my loan properly forgiven. At this point, I have paid back all of the money I actually borrowed, especially if you account for the incorrect principal and rates. All I want is the treatment I thought I was getting from the start. Im not trying to get more than I deserve, although I wouldnt argue- considering.

AES attempts to combine the amounts due on billing statements if the loans share a common due date and meet other criteria. However, you may still receive individual delinquency emails on a single day because you have several loans with a shared due date and different owners.

**RESPONSE Aes is violating several harassment clauses which undermines and breaks Federal law protecting consumers from unwanted and overstepping communication ** Specifically, two delinquency emails were sent on XX/XX/2021 for the past-due installment from XX/XX/2021 one for the XXXX Loan held by the National Collegiate Student Loan Trust ( NCT ) and one for the XXXX XXXX owned by PHEAA XXXX In addition, the AES representatives sent emails in response to your email inquiries. AES does not consent to the recording of telephone calls by customers. AES records calls for quality assurance purposes. If you do not wish for the call to be recorded, then you may choose to disconnect the call and communicate through a different method. 
**RESPONSE I also do not consent to being recorded for any purpose whatsoever. If Aes records the calls at any time in the future that a call is placed, Aes is violating Pennsylvania Wiretapping laws. I have never recorded calls with Aes. I do have reason to believe that Aes is still recording the phone calls even after I make several statements making my asserted claim that I do not wish to be recorded. Aes is violating the Wiretapping privacy law.

** Loan forgiveness programs ( for federal loans ) are authorized under federal regulations and ( for private loans ) are authorized by the owner/holders. Contrary to your allegation, AES does not intentionally prolong the qualification requirements for loan forgiveness in order to make a profit. 
**RESPONSE Despite Aess continued notions of the aforementioned claim, Aes is outright not telling the truth. Aes has no idea who Ive spoken to and all of the evidence I have proving this lie wrong. Aes can be assured that they would be wise to tell the truth instead of making things up just to protect their own companys interests, especially if what they are doing is against the law.

** Response to CFPB Case # s XXXX and XXXX : You may be assured that your payment of {$380.00} was credited to the loans effective XX/XX/2021. This payment restored the loans to current statuses. Typically, it takes several days for payments to be processed, and holidays can extend the processing period. Therefore, you are encouraged to allow sufficient time for processing so that the payments can be posted by the due date.

**RESPONSE Sufficient time does not equate to days worth of processing time, and Aes has no basis for creating a delay and then intentionally creating a barrier for consumers because they insistently delay the processing for reasons that are not the consumers problem.

** Regardless of how many processing days are required, however, payments are still credited effective the date of receipt. Based upon our review, interest has accrued accurately on the loans. We have sent Summaries of Financial Activity to you under separate cover to verify the application of payments to your account. You may be assured that no unfavorable information is scheduled to be submitted to the consumer reporting agencies about your loans for XX/XX/2021. If you believe that inaccurate information exists on your credit report, you may wish to dispute the information or submit a copy of your credit report to AES for further investigation. Finally, we regret that the level of service you received did not meet with your expectations, and we apologize on behalf of the agency for any inconvenience that you may have experienced in this matter. No instances of inappropriate activity were identified on your account, and no additional action is planned at this time. If you have any additional questions, please contact AES through the website at aesSuccess.org or via the mobile app ( AES Student Loans ).

**RESPONSE Several instances of inappropriate activity were logged on my end including references to Employee IDs and may be shared with litigators. Aes failing to recognize or admit to their own faults makes it that much easier to start bringing class action lawsuits against the company.

It is unclear to me ( and hundreds of other borrowers ) currently in this limbo why there can not be more transparency about this process. It is also frustrating to call different customer service representatives and be given a different answer each time. The goal of this program was to encourage people to work for non-profits and governmental agencies for a period of 10 years but in effect, it is actually tying them in place for 10.5 years.

10/06/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to request assistance. I am imploring you to help me. I have been a faithful public servant for over ten years and I am frustrated by a broken public student loan forgiveness program. I know this complaint will not shock you, as this program has been in the news lately, and the XXXX program was passed in XXXX to address these issues. 

I will start off with a little bit about myself. I come from a family of humble means and was the first member of my family to graduate from college. I was raised by a single mother who wanted more for her children, then she herself had, and therefore instilled in us the importance of a college degree. I graduated high school and proceeded to the XXXX XXXX  XXXX for XXXX, taking out student loans to finance my education. I graduated in four years with a XXXX degree while working XXXX jobs. I took the XXXX and was granted admission the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attended XXXX XXXX  at night in order to work full time during XXXX XXXX I also took out student loans to finance my XXXX XXXX  education. I worked full time during the last three years of XXXX XXXX  as a XXXX XXXX for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, when I graduated XXXX XXXX in XXXX the economy was drastically different than when I entered XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I witnessed some of the top students in my XXXX XXXX class not be able to secure employment. Luckily for me, due to my performance and work ethic I was offered a job at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX as an XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX after I passed the bar exam. Upon, my hiring as a public service servant making a meager salary of $ XXXX a year I was panicked about how I would be able to afford the {$100000.00} debt that I had accumulated due to my higher education. I researched many options. I agonized over how I would one day get married and have kids due to this enormous debt hanging over my head. 

Through my research I identified the public student loan forgiveness program. I spent hours researching and making sure that I knew every inch of the Law, and that I did everything correctly to qualify. I made sure to consolidate my loans to a direct loan and to get on the correct payment plan. I knew that if I made the decision to pursue this route, I would be incurring significant interest charges and that I would be committing to public service and therefore less compensation for the next 10 years. 

Over the next ten years, I made every payment timely and I certified my employment throughout that time. I did everything correctly to qualify for PSLF while serving my community. Over the last six months I have spent countless hours on the phone and tracking down documentation to prove to Fedloan Servicing that my loans qualify for forgiveness. This has been met with extreme frustration. 

Fedloan Servicing was not counting nineteen payments that I made early in the program in XXXX and XXXX. Through many hours of conversation and research, I was told by Fedloan to request bank statements to prove I made the payments. I went and paid over a hundred dollars to get these records pulled from the archives of my bank. I then provided them to Fedloan Servicing. I was told my payment count was under review for months. 

I finally filed a complaint with the Department of Education in XXXX. I was thrilled to log in to Fedloans website in early XXXX and see that Fedloan Servicing had updated my student loan payment count and that I qualify for forgiveness ( see attached screenshot ). I excitedly called Fedloan and was told I needed to file out one final certification, which was done immediately, and then I needed to wait for final notification of forgiveness. I even received written notification of this update to my payment count via correspondence on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached correspondence ). 

Every day for weeks I have anxiously logged into Fedloan waiting for this final notice. Imagine my dismay when I wake up this morning and see the correspondence ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) from Fedloan, stating I do not qualify for forgiveness and now setting my payment count at 98 payments under XXXX. I immediately was sick to my stomach and have been distressed all day over this correspondence. 

I need help. I have attempted to do everything right in life to make a better life for myself and give back to my community. I have followed ALL the rules and documented everything extensively. If I, a XXXX XXXX can not navigate this system, it is severely broken. I am begging for assistance. I need help from someone with more power to intervene in this situation. I am XXXX years old and have not had children due to this debt. I am also extremely nervous about Fedloan Servicing transferring my records at the end of this year, as my discrepancy in payment count was blamed on my prior servicer. 

Please assist in any way you can. Please feel free to reach me at ( XXXX ) XXXX and XXXX. 

Thank you.

05/15/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I consolidated ALL of my student loans and set them up on the REPAYE plan ( revised pay as you earn plan ) on XX/XX/XXXX. After consolidating, the consolidation loan was moved to FedLoan Servicing. 

Everything was going fine until I noticed one day that my account information had changed. FedLoan Servicing had separated out my one consolidated loan into two separate loans in my online account. The separation was done by whether or not the loan was subsidized or unsubsidized but the problem is the payments were not reflecting the same amount of payments which previously they had been. 

Of course, I have always made my "" one '' payment each month so FedLoan had been correctly applying the payment to my one loan and then to my new two loans. The payments on both of these FedLoans should ALWAYS be the same number. The whole purpose of consolidating is that you are making "" one '' payment on "" one '' loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called and spoke with "" XXXX '' and his rep ID is XXXX. I explained to XXXX that my payments were no correct because one FedLoan is showing 28 payments and the other is showing only 25. I told XXXX that they should both be showing the same number of payments of 28. 

XXXX explained to me that the reason my Loan # 1 and # 2 are not accurately showing the same amount of qualified payments out of 120 payments is because XXXX on XXXX of XXXX and on XXXX of XXXX put an extra XXXX on my unsubsidized loan ( loan # 1 ) and took away a XXXX on my subsidized loan ( loan # 2 ) and therefore ; they portioned it out incorrectly. 

I immediately requested for the obvious "" error '' to get corrected. On XX/XX/XXXX I called back and spoke to XXXX ID : XXXX. I was under the understanding that this error would be corrected quickly but XXXX told me that my case was under review and XXXX did confirm that both loan 1 and 2 should show the exact same payments made. I again requested for the error to be corrected immediately. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, her rep ID is XXXX. She was not much help. She told me that the people that are closest to reaching their 120 payments made take priority, and that there is a lot of manual calculation in these cases. 

Please note, when I make 120 payments, the remaining of my loan balance is supposed to be forgiven since I am an XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX, and her rep ID is XXXX. She said she could not help me and she had to transfer me to the PSLF ( public service loan forgiveness department ). I was then transferred to XXXX, and her rep ID is XXXX. XXXX told me the review is still open, and the discrepancy happened in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX with XXXX, and that the name of the department that reviews the XXXX records is Treasury Management with FedLoan Servicing. 

XXXX told me that there is no turnaround time on these reviews, and that someone would call me when my case is reviewed and not email me. Then she said I would get an email if I have elected paperless. 

I am tired of getting the run-a-round with this agency. They have admitted with multiple people that there is an error on my account and that both of their loans on my account should indeed be showing the same number of payments ( 28 ). This is a lot of money and this is an easy fix to me. 

I should not have to wait until I'm closer to the 120 payment threshold for someone to correct my account. It seems like the longer I wait the greater chance for FedLoans to forget or not remember what is going on with my account. 

I need my account corrected to reflect that both of the FedLoans have the "" same '' number of payments. Again, I am making one payment each month which is then split by FedLoan Servicing between my subsidized and my unsubsidized loans. There is no way that these two loans should be showing different amounts of payments. One is showing 28 payments made and the other is showing only 25 payments made.

Because of my bad previous experience years ago, when a Perkins Loan I had was transferred to the U.S. Department of Education was incorrectly reported as default, past due, delinquent, no matter all the evidence showed that was not true at all, but no matter all the evidence I submitted even using here the C.F.P.B. the fact is that error, or maybe is best to call it horror, was never fixed correctly on my credit report, knowing the catastrophic damage an error like this provokes in anyone credit reports, and this error or horror I experienced was the same problem many thousands of students experienced back then unfairly. 

This time, a mistake, or even a computer or Internet pro hack, or something worse, no matter all the evidence shows is not true, shows a payment I made to my American Education Services XXXX last XX/XX/2021, as to be paid 7 days later, so it appears as past due 3 days, or delinquent, until is fully debited within a couple of days? 

What if something goes wrong and my accounts with AES are reported past due incorrectly to the 3 credit bureaus? I can't allow that to happen again. 

Today is XX/XX/2021, but my record shows I never submit a payment to AES in that manner, but that I always pay to be debited immediately if that was possible in this case it was submitted last XX/XX/2021, to be paid that same day if possible and I submitted hours ago the evidence showing AES that the funds are available in my account waiting for the AES debit since XX/XX/2021 there was no reason for me to let an incorrect date equal to a 7 days delay at all as the included uploaded documents clearly show, including my chat XXXX, from AES Live Chat Customer Service of today just minutes ago, included here also so the C.F.P.B. and AES could see why I am worried. 

The evidence I am accumulating here at the C.F.P.B.is showing a pattern not only showing I document everything with every piece of evidence I find, but also, that the possibility that people with key positions anywhere, could also be sponsoring discriminatory practices against us just because they do not like people who speak XXXX, are described as XXXX, or because we come from an Island they do not recognize no matter we are citizens, they do not care, if others are not citizens makes no difference for them either. 

XXXX, is the only credit bureau sending us surveys in which they recognize this problem, when they ask us several questions about discrimination in their surveys. But, what about the other 2 main credit bureaus? 

Just in case the evidence I uploaded hours ago through the American Education Services website, showing the same I am including here falls in the hands of someone sponsoring discriminatory practices, and simply takes advantage of this mistake to incorrectly report my account as delinquent as mentioned during the chat by XXXX, no matter she apologized several times for this. 

I want to have a clear record here just in case something worse happens again.

05/26/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Wells Fargo has been the holder on my private student loan accounts for several years. At the end of XXXX of XXXX they sold my student loans to XXXX XXXX, an excellent company. At the time of the sale I was currently attempting a loan modification as the amount I was being asked to pay was too great, and I was informed during this process to do the best I could to keep up with the payments, and that when the loan modification was complete anything negative would be erased. I was told to make best efforts. 

However, before completing the loan modification process the loans were transferred to XXXX XXXX. I called in on XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment to Wells Fargo and to make sure my account was in good standing and up to date. I was told that my account, and account information, had been transferred to XXXX XXXX. I was given their number, and called them. I was informed by XXXX XXXX that I had a past due amount that Wells Fargo had not informed me of correctly at anytime before the 30 day period prior to XX/XX/XXXX, when it would hit my credit score. I specifically asked if there was anything negative on my account when I spoke with the Wells Fargo Representative on XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed that the account was in Good Standing when it was transferred to XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my Credit Score took a major hit of 50 points because Wells Fargo reported a missed payment. I was shocked because I was informed by Wells Fargo that my account was in good standing on XX/XX/XXXX and that there were no issues. In attempting to deal with this with Wells Fargo they said that what was told to me on the XXXX did not matter because it was after the 30 day time frame, and that I should have known. Yet in the conversation with the loan modification people at Wells Fargo I was told to make best efforts. 

Wells Fargo claims to have called and sent me information. I received no phone calls. I received no letters, regardless of whether or not they say they sent them. I never got them. I am now being blamed for a situation where-in I am being placed at fault for acting on information that Wells Fargo gave me. 

This is not the first time Wells Fargo communication has been lack luster at best. They never made, what I consider, to be best efforts to contact me, despite me repeatedly asking them to call me if there was an issue on my account, THEY NEVER CALLED ME. The only way that I ever knew of an issue on my account was to call them. I spent years attempting to rebuild my credit, and because Wells Fargo refuses to admit that they made a mistake I could very well be forced to rebuild my credit again, unfairly. 

The poor customer service and selling of debt, and rebuying apparently, has made me so paranoid with Wells Fargo that I am no recording all my phone calls with them to ensure that they are forced to be held to their word. Despite promises to resolve the issue in an equitable manner Wells Fargo has gone, "" You're account is no longer with us. So it isn't our problem. We don't care how the information you acted upon was relayed, and whether or not our representatives made a mistake in telling you wrong information. If you acted on information from us that was wrong, that is your fault not ours. '' The paradox here is astounding. Consistently they have shown NO regard for me as a customer, and my opinions or issues or life problems have been disregarded.

05/13/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I attended XXXX University in XXXX XXXX, VA from XXXX to XXXX. During that time, I received yearly student loans to pay my tuition. After I graduated, I got a deferment from repayment. Unfortunately, in the 18 years since I graduated, I have lost my original loan paperwork and I don't remember exactly when I started to repay the load. 

Currently, my student loans are serviced by Navient. I started working for the federal government in XXXX. Shortly after that, I had my school loan payment automatically deducted from my paycheck. I retired in XXXX of XXXX and contacted Navient in XXXX of XXXX to find out how much I still owed on my loans. 

It was very difficult to get an exact accounting of my loan history from Navient. They sent me a two-page history of my loan payments for the years XXXX through XXXX. In addition, they sent me a very confusing printout of my loan activity beginning in XXXX. They did not explain the reasoning for how my loan payments were being applied before XXXX. 

Also, it appears my principal loan amount changed over the years. On one of the Navient reports it says my original loan amount was {$80000.00}. On that same document, it says my original loan amount was {$84000.00}. In the report they sent me that covers the years from XXXX to XXXX ( although the years XXXX to XXXX are very confusing ) it shows that I made payments every month by automatic deduction from my paycheck in amounts varying from {$310.00} to {$380.00} per month. Because the report is so disjointed, I can not be sure of the exact amount that I have repaid so far. Nonetheless, my calculations indicate that I have paid more that {$32000.00} on my school loans. However, their report shows that I still owe {$80000.00}. In other words, despite my re-paying more than {$32000.00} on this loan, my principal has only gone down about {$4000.00}. 

When I took these school loans it was my understanding that these were low-interest loans guaranteed by the federal government. I know many people have defaulted on their school loans, but I am not one of those people. I paid the required payment every month for many years. I just want my original loan amount calculated correctly and repayment be made fairly, in accordance with the intention of the loan programs.

04/09/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I need your help immediately. 
I am an XXXX XXXX  and took out a student loan around XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX school. I paid everything on time, and got a good travel XXXX contract and decidedto call inXX/XX/XXXX to increasemy monthly payments to $ XXXX per month. 

Instead of increasing it, Wells Fargo DELETED all of it, then reported me to the credit bureaus with fraudulentdocuments. I was harassedwhile working in the ICU, andtold I was worthless by the debt collectors. The harassment was very intense. 

Wells Fargorefused to talk to me, and refused/blocked my ability to log into my account. Due to nepotism, I begged someone in my family whoused to work for Wells Fargo and eventually was able to get them to talk to me. 

Creditors bullied & harassedme until, under severe distress I was manipulated into signing to reconsolidate the loan. They withheld information and gaslit me when I told them this was illegal and the contract was broken by them and it is null and void. 

I did not want to sign it and I made it clear to them that I did not want to, but I needed the phone calls to stop and I needed my credit score repaired. That is black mail I believe, correct me if I am wrong, Im not a lawyer. ( They had me resign with them saying they would give me a "" good deal '' which is trash ) Then they messed up my payments for about 6 months after that as well, and then I still could not log intomy account consistently inXX/XX/XXXX. 

There had been times years ago, I could log in briefly to view my account, yet I could not adjust my payments or how they were applied. Currently I still have no access to my account, despite calling IT and being put on hold or in circles extensively & speaking with the "" executive branch '' of Wells Fargo. Over the years I call them or pop into a branch wanting someone to deal with it, and nothing ever changes. They have wasted weeks of my time and energy dealing with them. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, when I had more time to try to tackle this again, I went into my local branch frequently with no outcome. Finally someone gave me a card with a number to call, and they made it sound like it was their clean up team for Wells Fargo. That was mostly a dead end & the worker there never called me like she was supposed to then I found out that they were transferring my loan to a different corporation. I refused the transfer and demanded they give me back all my money from the incident to now. 

I demanded it get escalated which took me having a phone tantrum to get it escalated to their managers there. They said they would help and resolve the issue and they reported to me it is DOCUMENTED that they had DELETED my payment history before and was send off to the credit bureaus incorrectly. I also have emails from then. I ask them for copies of my notes which they refused unless I have a subpoena. It is my information and my financial livelihood, there needs to be a change in laws around that. 

They have broken so many laws. 

I have been trying to talk with them for years and they ignore me. I still am unable to log in to my account. I tried to enter into the class action lawsuit and the email link never worked and when I called they would put my on hold and put me in phone circles. 

They have broken the XXXX Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, they have committed fraud, turned in fraud documents to the debt collections agencies, and the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practice Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

They still to this dateXX/XX/XXXXdo not allow me to log into my account, I just got off the phone with them again this AM and I was put into a holding pattern by them. 

I have been unable to pay more than the minimum or ensure it is being applied to the principle how I want, because I have been locked out of my account, I wouldhave had this loan paid off already if I could have accessed my account. Instead, they are bleeding me dry and making gains off my compacted interest and inability to access my account online. Most importantly, the ENTIRE LOAN IS FRAUD and they need to give me my money back. 

They have also consistently had my incorrect address and phone number even though I have had the same phone number since cell phones came out and I have corrected them countless times about this information. 

I called WF again this AM XX/XX/XXXX to get them to fix my account so I can log in, yet I was put in a holding loop. 

I want to know what your office do for me today. They may try to transfer the loan on XX/XX/XXXXor shortly after. 

Best Regards & please respond quickly. Im really stressed and scared.

04/05/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I co-signed my wife 's {$3500.00} student loan through Citizens Bank as she was finishing up her final year of college. She graduated in XX/XX/XXXX, which means the repayment started in XX/XX/XXXX. She went online to establish auto-payments for her loans. Citizens Bank does not coalesce their loans into one payment ; no, that would be too easy for the consumers. Instead, my wife had to set up auto-pay at least three separate times, once for each different loan she had to take during her years in college. I personally have students loans through two other lenders that are not Citizens Bank, and my wife has another lender outside of Citizens Bank. In our experience, Citizens Bank is the only one that breaks up repayment in this fashion by default. 

My wife set up auto-pay which appeared to be working as we started receiving "" Thank you for your Payment '' emails in XXXX with payments coming out on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. It wasn't until months later that we found out we overlooked setting up auto-pay for one of the several loans that were taken out over the years. Citizens Bank did not notify me until they put the loan in delinquency. No mail notification, no emails ( only the "" Thank you for your payment '' again in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) no phone calls, until the loan is now delinquent. We had full intention and means to repay this loan, but their website and their repayment system is not intuitive and not user-friendly. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens Bank mailed out a letter indicating the loan is delinquent, which I received on XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX Customer Service was able to navigate me to the correct loan and I promptly paid the current balance. 

After this negative experience, I did not want to give XXXX Bank any more interest off of that loan, so on XX/XX/XXXX I went back and paid off the remaining balance of the entire loan. I then called XXXX XXXX to file a contention of the delinquent report to the credit bureaus as this issue came up solely by the unorthodox nature of repayment for multiple loans, lack of meaningful communication that one of the loans was not being paid, and an unintuitive website that required a call to customer service to successfully navigate. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens Bank denied my contention for credit reporting adjustment based on the fact they "" do not offer courtesy credit report retractions. '' This entire issue stems from Citizens Bank. My wife and I tried to follow the rules, and we had repayment activity across our account, but Citizens Bank 's website made it extraordinarily difficult to establish and verify proper repayment when you have multiple loans with them.

I have reached out to them and the Ombudsman group many, many times regarding my application status. I submitted my FOIA request for all my payment history, and I uploaded all my bank statements ( with the loan payments highlighted ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I have made XXXX payments on loans 1 and 2 and 122 payments on loans 3 and 4 as of the end of XXXX. I applied for XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX for loans 1 and 2, and again in XX/XX/XXXX for loans 3 and 4. FedLoan continues to provide me with conflicting information every time I call. No one will tell me the status of my application. I would like to know why my application has not been process and why my loans have not been forgiven. Borrowers who applied after me have already had their loans forgiven, which can be verified in the XXXX  group that is mentioned below. 

Here is the text of the last email I sent to FedLoan and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX : Hi, My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am writing ( again ) in regards to my communication with FedLoan and my XXXX applications. 

I have four loans total. Loans 1 and 2 were eligible for forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX when they reached 120 payments. I submitted an updated XXXX/app that month, but nothing progressed with FedLoan. I experienced the same thing with Loans 3 and 4 in XX/XX/XXXX. I am still waiting to hear anything more than my account is "" under review. '' I submitted all my bank statements and FOIA request results for my payment history in summer XXXX because FedLoan didn't have record of many of my payments from previous lenders. FedLoan did nothing with that info, even though I asked them to update all my payments that were under a manual review. At that point, I had an Ombudsman rep working on my case with FedLoan. After she was involved, my payments in FedLoan were updated and everything seemed correct. With that in mind, and with all the info being updated and corrected, it seems like my forgiveness process should be more efficient and timely, but it's not. FedLoan has all the necessary payment history and proof in my bank statements and FOIA results, but it doesn't seem to speed up the process at all. 

I belong to this group : https : XXXX? ref=share Members who receive their forgiveness often post photos of when they received letters or info from FedLoan, and they often share their timelines in their application process, and the proof is in the photos. There have been many people who submitted their XXXX applications after me and have already had their loans forgiven with a zero balance in their FedLoan account. I am extremely frustrated that my situation is not progressing like theirs. 

When I call FedLoan every week to get an update, I am told different things by each rep. Nothing is consistent. Then, what the reps type in as notes doesn't usually match what they actually told me over the phone. This could be verified by listening to the recorded calls. I feel like I am constantly being given inaccurate information. Reps also say they will look into my account and call me back, but they don't follow through. Today when I called, the escalated rep basically told me there is nothing FedLoan can do and that I just need to wait because there are people in front of me in the process. I did not receive that well after I saw more people in the XXXX  group show photos of their account and FedLoan letters when their loans were already forgiven before mine even though they submitted their app after I did. I don't understand why what is happening with my loans and my accounts is not being shared with me. Why can't FedLoan explain what my status is or where I am in the process? Why can't they be open and honest about things? 

It's now been 4 months since I submitted my app for loans 1 and 2. It's been 1 month for loans 3 and 4. I don't want to find out months from now that I missed something on the app or that there was an issue with anything. I want to know now if everything is as it should be, so I don't end up with another delay down the road. I want to be kept in the loop along the way so I don't end up more frustrated than I already am. 

I would appreciate any factual info I can get regarding my loans and my status in the XXXX  process. I am extremely unhappy with the service I've received at FedLoan.

05/26/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am in the public service student loan forgiveness program for more than a decade. According to MyFedLoan, my servicer, thirty-one of my payments do not count. 

I am trying to be specific with the numbers, but it is difficult since MyFedLoan seems to have a chronic problem getting back to me with updates. They stopped counting more than a year ago for unknown reasons. I have been submitting paperwork since asking for an update via forms as instructed, with usually no response. I might wait weeks or months and call, only to find out that they dismissed the letter and neglected to inform me. The reason for the dismissal is always an excuse as to why my paperwork did not count. The reasons the paperwork I submitted does not count have included : there is a visible staple hole in one of the papers and there was a paperclip submitted. The last time I called, XX/XX/XXXX, the person on the phone told me that my paperwork was not accepted because there was no signature. When she looked at it, she confirmed that there was, indeed, a signature on the paper. 

As a result of this and other conduct that is obviously shady, I can only assume that I am being treated unfairly and possibly unlawfully. The reasons that many of my more than thirty payments supposedly dont count rests on the premise that I was paying my last student loan company for fun, as there was an administrative forbearance and my payments didnt count. When asked for information about this, they claim to have none. While it may be true they have no further information from the previous company, surely it seems unlikely that someone would make payments for no reason at all. If there is no more information to be had, why presume the most unlikely scenario? 

Other payments are said to have been made too late. I know that, as an educator that made considerably less money during the summers and winters, I would frequently pay ahead. For instance, in XXXX I would pay for XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX as well as XXXX. I believe that it is very likely that many of these forward payments are being counted dishonestly in such a way as to make a claim that I am behind, instead of ahead, so that each payment is offset in a way that they can discount. 

In the past, years ago when they would allow me to submit the paperwork to see what I owed, I was told that paying ahead did not count. I have since found documentation showing that it in fact does. 

Finally, on the XX/XX/XXXX call, the agent could not find any reason at all why between 15-20 payments did not count. This was elevated along with my signed paperwork that was dismissed as not having been signed. When asked how long it would take to hear back, I was told it was impossible to say. 

I am not looking for anything that I am not entitled to. I have been paying for this ten-year plan for more than ten years. Its outrageous to assume that these many payments do not qualify. Its also obscene that I can not get any further information because MyFedLoan is discounting my requests for petty reasons, and its unconscionable that I can not get an answer as to when, or how, any of this will be addressedlet alone resolved. 

At this point, I can only beg to count enough of the more than thirty payments to get me out of this trap, the trap I should have been released from years ago.",None,AES/PHEAA,OR,97214,None,Consent provided,Web,05/26/21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4406241

PSLF requires 120 payments to be made while working in a public or non-profit agency, which I have. I've never worked in the private sector. I graduated and began my repayments in XX/XX/2012 and that means I've worked non-stop since that time.

04/23/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have received 15 phone calls between Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX and Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I finally called the number back at about XXXX to see what they wanted and who they were since they werent leaving any voicemails. I called them back a second time, this time with my wife being on the phone with me to help deal with the issue. 

I was active duty military from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and then was active reserves from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. They do not have a military policy listed, I would of had to call a separate number to discuss any kind of program to be put on. I had both federal loans ( 8 ) and private loans ( 2 ) with this particular lender. I do not know why I was only able to take out 8 federal loans and the last 2 loans needed to be private. My payments went towards the federal loans first and they are all paid off. The last 2 loans were private. Why the federal loans were paid off before the private loans, I dont know. I just made the payments and Navient applied them there is also several fees applied to my loans which I do not understand along with terms like resale, reversed payment, forbearance payment and adjustment. There is even a late charge for one month of {$100.00} on a principal amount of {$8300.00}. 

I briefly qualified for their income based repayment plan and then was kicked off without notice. I went back to school in XXXX of XXXX to further my education and just graduated during the pandemic. As of Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX to today Friday XX/XX/XXXX I had received a total of 15 phone calls. The 15th phone call happen while I was on the phone with a representative of Navient. Was told while on the phone with the representative that I had called back in time before they reported everything to the credit bureaus. The representative put me on a, what I thought was a rate reduction program, but was put on an interest only payment program. The website specifically states that the rate reduction program is good for 6 months whereas the interest only program does not. I agreed to this program and hung up with the representative. After discussing all this information with my wife, we ended up calling back Navient and discussing other options that are listed on the website. The representative we were talking to the 2nd time eventually transferred us to a supervisor/manager to which we were going round in circles to get a much better explanation on why I wasnt able to qualify for Term and Rate Modification Program. All the supervisor/manager would keep saying that is these programs do not apply to me. 

While talking to representative and supervisor/manager we kept asking what the qualifications were for these programs and the representative kept on saying that she had a bad connection and couldnt hear me and was still unable to answer the questions which then she transferred me to the supervisor/manager. I was told that there was no grace period after graduation and needed to start paying immediately. I was informed that I didnt qualify for the Rate Reduction Plan even after the last representative from the very first call said I did, and then was told that I was put down for an Interest Only Plan which was not told to me. I requested numerous times documentation as to why I dont qualify for these plans and what the qualifications for these plans were and the supervisor/manager said that he does not have that kind of form letter. I stated to him that I was not asking for a form letter but documentation of why I did not qualify for these programs that are offered. Supervisor/manager said that each case is dependent on several things and figured out on a personal basis. However he was not able to give me any qualifications or tell me anything personal regarding my case as to why I didnt qualify. I also asked for a printed copy of my payments and documentation of when I was on the Rate Reduction Plan and they did not think they could get that information either. 

I was falsely told I was on an Income Based Payment Plan when that was a Rate Reduction Plan for 6 months and then told today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I was on a Rate Reduction Plan when they entered in the notes as an Interest Only Plan. My interest continues to increase to a now 9.75 % There website does not clarify any qualifications for any of these programs and neither can the customer service or management. They also stated they do not have documentation of this. How is this fair to me and any other borrower. If I was able to be on the rate reduction program I would not be in the spot of struggling with payments like I am.

05/19/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My complaint is highly related to incorrect financial reporting/abuse conducted by Navient and Studentaid.gov. In XXXX I consolidated my student loans with Sallie Mae so that they were all with one lender, Sallie Mae. Later down the road I was notified by another lender that I was late or have missed payments on my student loans, but what turned out to be an error in which an account was left off consolidation. 

So in XXXX, I had to do another consolidation to include the missing account, which was a very small amount XXXX {$3500.00} XXXX. The statement received in XXXX of XXXX shows that my total balance was {$52.00}, XXXX. Some of my loans were with other lenders even though I had consolidated them all with SallieMae. 

In XXXX, some of my loans were given to XXXX by Federal Student Aid, and I am not sure why as XXXX was never my lender and I had not requested them during any consolidation application. 

XXXX begin to report XXXX via my credit ) in the later part of XXXX and had placed these accounts on my credit file with late payment marks, affecting my credit worthiness, which is what in part prompted bankruptcy. I sent them a good faith letter asking them to remove the late payments, as my loans should have never been assigned to them, but they refused to help. They advised me that I needed to contact Federal Student Aid to see how some of my loans were assigned to them. 

I ended up having to do another loan consolidation, as I did not want any of my loans with any other lenders. I have only and always selected SallieMae/Navient. When SallieMae changed to Navient things just seem to go downhill and they have not been the same. My loan balance was {$52.00}, XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX, and skyrocketed to {$84000.00} by XXXX. 

I have not taken out any student loans since XXXX, as I was near the XXXX loan max of {$57000.00}. So I contacted Navient in again XXXX to have the matter regarding the incorrect balance corrected and for them to provide me proof. I requested for them to send me all promissory notes, loan disbursement dates, all consolidation applications ( along with dates submitted ), and loan amounts provided. I have yet to receive all of this information. What I did receive were letters that all did not have dates, and I was only provided partial of the requested documents, so I could not compare the details against the financial aid documents I recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) obtained from all institutions that I took out loans with. I am not even able to match the account numbers reported on my credit file to any information with my studentaid.gov account or within my Navient account. If there were 8 consolidations done on my account, why was I not provided with all XXXX applications with dates so that I can reference my notes. 

I was also being charged interest while in-school XXXX years XXXX XXXX, and year XXXX ) and on both loans and Navient advised me that none of my school were not reporting me as enrolled. I then provided them documentation XXXX enrollment letter XXXX that I was in fact enrolled. They still refused to modify my account. I then ( still in XXXX XXXX filed a complaint with the Ombudsman department, as I was not receiving the information I requested from Navient. I have been working on this concern for over 3 years, and I recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) filed another complaint with the ombudsman group regarding this entire concern, and they basically recapped everything I had told them, in an email back to me without additional details or guidance that was received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX - I filed a case with the ombudsman group regarding the incorrect balance of my student loans reporting on my credit reports, and also because Navient has not provided the requested information I've asked them for. 

On XX/XX/XXXX - I called Navient, spoke with XXXX, and we spent over an hour trying to go over my consolidations and loan details. XXXX advised me that there are only two loans were taken out by SallieMae, and that she shows 4 consolidations being done on my account. However, when I log in to my studentaid.gov account it shows that 8 consolidations were done on my account. Some of which do not show where the attending school was nor how much was taken out per term, they only show high balances. A consolidation is to bring all accounts into one account for easy management and it seems that my consolidations were consolidated from a consolidation into another consolidation, only to be consolidated again. Meaning, it seems as if balances that were already included in the consolidation were added again when the consolidation was corrected, only it was still not corrected. This is highly frustrating. 

There is no way that my loan balance increased well over $ XXXX within a XXXX year period, when I never exceeded XXXX loan maximums.

I have been working for the State of California in an attempt to gain loan forgiveness. ( PSLF ). I have recently hit my 10 year mark and started communicating with the company ( Myfedloan.org ). 
Contact with my college 's financial aid department ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), has not helped. After several calls and endless hours waiting on hold, speaking to XXXX XXXX and being referred to a supervisor XXXX XXXX that XXXX "" can't help '' me. 
I finally found a phone number for PSLF and began calling them XX/XX/XXXX, as XX/XX/XXXX would mark my 10 year anniversary with the State of California. 
XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX ( # XXXX ). I was told that applying for PSLF takes months and months and that I just had to wait for them to tally my payments. However, I still had to be working for the State in order for my loans to be forgiven- but they dont know how long the tally will take. Maybe 6-9 months sometimes. 
I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with Geargia ( # XXXX ). She was very pleasant and very helpful! She explained that I still needed to send an email to begin the Temporary Expanded PSLF process. ( Although, I had all intents of using PSLF, I was somehow not on the correct loan type. Unfortunately, the current company does not have the ability to look at the old companies records ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX ( # XXXX ) who told me that my tally was ready and that I still needed 20 more payments ( once the COVID forbearance ends XX/XX/XXXX ) to be eligible for TEPSLF. I was told that I could make back payments. At this point, I discussed it with my family and decided that I would use some bonds and gift money to pay off the loans. I made my withdrawals of money that was earning interest, and sent {$3000.00} to myfedloan.org. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I once again called myfedloan.org to see why my back payments had not been credited. I talked to XXXX ( # XXXX ) who had no PSLF experience. She transferred me to XXXX ( # XXXX ) who stated that in order for back payments to be made, I would need to talk to a supervisor to get an over ride. She transferred me to a supervisor named XXXX ( # XXXX ). XXXX proceeded to tell me that all of the information I had collected from the company was false. He could not give me an over ride. He was somewhat apologetic that I had pulled money out of interest bearing funds that could not be returned, and said there were no other options for me. He couldn't look into my loans with past borrowers. And, the fact that I was given false information about back payments did not qualify as an error on the part of the company that would allow for an over ride. 
I have received so much contradictory information. It seems like every time I call there is a different story. So, this is where I am stuck.

03/28/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I began making payments towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) under a qualifying payment plan in XXXX. I have applied three times for student loan forgiveness with my current loan provider, Federal Loan Servicing. I initially applied for PSLF on XX/XX/XXXX, and was wrongfully denied on XX/XX/XXXX due to four payments I made in XXXX not being applied towards my forgiveness application ( XXXX XXXX ). My XX/XX/XXXX payment was also not taken into account for my application for a total of 5 payments. Federal Loan Servicing states this was due to my loans transferring from XXXX XXXX. However, at the time of being denied forgiveness, my online account read "" We're working with your prior servicers to gather information to properly assess your payment history. '' This confirms I was denied forgiveness when payments were still being reviewed. To this date, there has been no follow-up from Federal Loan Servicing on my payment history with XXXX XXXX. 

I then applied for Temporary Expanded Public Loan Forgiveness ( TEPSLF ) on XX/XX/XXXX, which is a program you can apply for if your PSLF was denied. I also waited four months until the Federal Loan Servicing online system updated to reflect that I had made the 120 payments. In the meantime, I submitted three requests with Federal Loan Servicing for a review of payments ( dates of requests XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) ; two of these requests were denied and the XXXX request is currently pending and can take 90-180 days to complete a review. To this date, Federal Loan Servicing has not communicated with me on the results from any of these reviews and I have had no follow-up on the status of my TEPSLF application. To note, I also have not received any confirmation that I even applied for TEPSLF. 

I have since re-applied for PSLF on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. My account recently updated incorrectly. It went from 116 eligible payments to 118 eligible payments. It is missing employment verification for four months ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Federal Loan Servicing stating my PSLF application was denied.

09/13/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I learned that my federal student loan service by Navient has been on administrative hold due to a pending Borrower Defense application submitted on or about XX/XX/XXXX to the Department of Education, that I shouldn't have been making payments as I was doing. I wasn't notified by Navient that the account has been on an administrative hold, Navient constantly collected payments from me knowing this information. I reached out to a rep at Navient regarding this matter, asked for a refund which I am entitled to. The rep I spoke with at Navient confirmed this, calculated the total of my refund since the my account was placed on hold. She informed that refund will be issued within 7-10 business days. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient inquiring about the refund in which I didn't see, I was told by the rep that it due to the amount of the refund that the supervisor initially signed off on the approval wasn't authorized, it had to be submitted to an higher authority. I informed the rep that I rather have my refund direct deposit, she asked for my banking information to be direct deposit since I initially setup my payments via military allotment, the rep stated that I needed to provide something from my bank stating that was indeed my account information. My response to her why would I provide someone else banking information to get my refund. I provided the banking information from the bank as asked to do the same day. A few days later I was notified that the information that I provided didn't match what they have. I called Navient to informed them of course it won't match because it was created by me as a Military allotment after hours on the phone with them the rep ensure me that my refund was approved by the correct person that's authorized, it should be in my account within 7-10 days. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient to inquiry about the refund wasnt in my account, the rep I spoke with transfer me to the military side of Navient, I spoke with a XXXX, I had to explain everything over to her again about I had set up a military allotment, she stated that her counterparts didnt know what that is, since Im the borrower and the remitter Im correct the refund should have been sent back to me. And that the refund should hit my account around XXXX. My refund didnt hit my account as stated I called back to Navient , spoke with the rep XXXX XXXX XXXX had to give her all the information all from the beginning, after numerous holds and coming back to the phone she stated to me that the refund has been approve however it was an issue with my banking information, I stated to her that it won't match since it was a military allotment that was setup. She stated to me that she enters this information to a higher supervisor name XXXX that was working on my case along with XXXX to expedite it up since I was scheduled to get refunded awhile ago. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called back after getting a notification that Navient sent my refund to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I spoke with XXXX the supervisor that's supposedly working my case, he proceed to tell me different information from what his staff XXXX and XXXX told to me, and I told him as a supervisor he need to train his staff better with customer services, providing accurate information. He tells me since my information didn't match that Navient sent partial of my refund to XXXX and to the Treasury, they will issued the refund.

After calming down I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, reached XXXX I asked her to provide me with the check numbers and addresses of where my refund went to she was able to provide the information for XXXX but not the Treasury address, I informed her a complaint will be made.

Earlier this year, I contacted a legal referral group online and was given several options to pursue. When I explained the situation, I was encouraged to contact Navient for a copy of my original loan agreement. I did this but was only sent a summary of the loan. I have learned that the total amount to be paid is {$91000.00} for a loan with original principal of {$53000.00}. Moreover, as of XXXX, XXXX, my payments have jumped from {$290.00} to {$500.00}, with a payoff date of XXXX.

I wouldn't have known about Navient had I not been referred to this organization. 

Contacted the XXXX website and received several offices to contact. HOwever, when I explained the situation, I was encouraged to contact XXXX and list my legal issue as Consumer Law or Education Law. However, I haven't had success finding a lawyer in my area.

This excuse is unacceptable as the 180-day limit applies to a borrowers request, which I submitted and has yet to be correctly processed by the Department. Further, there is no time limit stopping the Department from processing a timely Request internally as it took 6 months for them to process the request and add the other loans. 

The other excuse I have been provided is that because XXXX XXXX processed the consolidation, they would have to complete the loan addition. This is impossible because Direct Loans no longer exists and the Department now contracts with FedLoan to process these consolidations. The suggestion that it would be impossible to correct the error because the Department now employs a different company to process these applications is outrageous. 

In the end, I was told that I had no recourse because the Ombudsmans Office has no enforcement power and could not compel the Department to take any action. There is no reason the Department can not correct this other than the fact that no one will take accountability for the mistake that was made and that there may not be a process that handles this issue easily. It makes it very easy to point the finger at an entity that no longer exists, but the bottom line is that XXXX XXXX was processing the consolidations on behalf of the Department. Now that responsibility has been contracted to FedLoan, who can certainly be instructed to process the request by someone at the Department. 

In 2017 I sought assistance from my congresswoman XXXX XXXX ' office, and received a letter acknowledging the error by XXXX XXXX but refusing to correct the mistake, also recommending a new separate consolidation for the single loan ( forgoing the years ' of qualifying payments ). 

I am reaching out to CFPB for help as a last resort as I near the 120-payment milestone for my PSLF and neither the ombudsman or congresswoman 's office were able to help. It simply does not make sense that the single loan omitted from the consolidation without my knowledge and through no fault of my own can not be added in accordance with my original application. 

I will attached a few of the documents, including my original consolidation application, the request to add loans, and an excerpt from the Ombudsmans case notes, which I hope will illustrate the issue and how it may be resolved with the cooperation of the Department. I wanted to keep my initial compliant and attachments brief but am happy to provide further detail or more documentation if necessary -- please do not hesitate to ask.

07/19/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"I have a number of private student loans with Firstmark Services. I am trying to refinance my loans to lower my monthly payment. I've called Firstmark Services serval times ( XX/XX/XXXX, twice onXX/XX/XXXX, and several times in the prior weeks ). When I contacted them about lowering the payments, they informed me that they only service the loans. They are not the lender and can not change the terms of the loan. The original lender was XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX informing me that they had transferred the servicing of my loans to Firstmark Services. ( By the way, Firstmark Services says they can not do any modifications only forbearance. ) When I asked Firstmark Serrvices for information on the lender, the name I was given was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). When I asked for contact information for XXXX, I was told that since XXXX had sold the loan to XXXX  in early XXXX, they did not have the contact information for me. I tried looking online myself and also could not find a phone number. This is completely unacceptable! I am paying monthly on loans and can not get the contact information for the lender. 

I am concerned that these banks and servicers are intentionally making it difficult for consumers. ( On a related note, I was told by Firstmark Services that I should seek to refinance my loans through a 3rd party lender. I tried that option but was unable to do so because I have a high debt-to-income ratio ( even though I have a high credit score and never miss payments ) It is precisely because I pay so much in student loans monthly that I need to reduce my monthly loan payments. )",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",NJ,07631,None,Consent provided,Web,07/19/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4556578

06/10/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Firstmark Services XXXX, the servicer of my XXXX student loans, erroneously charged me {$210.00} more than it was supposed to, did not refund that amount, and did not apply it to my student loans interest or principal. The overcharge was a result of several system and human errors accumulated over the period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX - see evidence below. Firstmark never disputed the evidence I submitted in my multiple requests to correct the errors. In fact, all four different customer representatives I spoke to in XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), admitted the error after going through all the details and promised to correct it. However, Firstmark never corrected it and never followed up. Instead, they kept adding new erroneous charges over and over again each time I complained, the last time writing off {$120.00} of my payments in an openly malicious manner, apparently, in retaliation to my complaints. Firstmark phone customer service takes on average an hour of waiting time per call to reach and oftentimes requires several such calls. Firstmark stopped responding to my complaints by email, the last one sent to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and also did not respond to my request sent over certified mail. 

Below is the detailed step-by-step description of what happened with references to the attached evidence : 1. In XX/XX/XXXX, upon my request, Firstmark switched me to six months of interest-only payments ( forbearance ), subject to auto-debit from my XXXX checking account. On the second of these six billing periods, on XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark charged me {$190.00} instead of {$99.00} - roughly double my regular amount of interest as compared to the previous and subsequent billing periods. The attached "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX '' incorrectly shows {$190.00} in interest charges for the billing cycle XXXX. The previous billing cycle "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX '' shows the correct amount of {$99.00} that should have remained relatively the same through my six months of interest-only payments, as does the next "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX '' that shows {$99.00}. The fact that the XXXX amount of {$190.00} is wrong can also be manually verified by applying my effective interest rate of 2.76 % to my total principal outstanding of {$43000.00} shown on the same "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX XXXX - ( {$43000.00} XXXX 2.76 % / XXXX ) * XXXX = {$96.00}. Note that since I complained about it, Firstmark generated a new ( alternative ) "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX '' for the same billing period of XXXX showing a correct {$96.00} amount that should have been charged instead of {$190.00}, but never refunded the difference. Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX Firstmark owed me approximately {$190.00} - {$96.00} = {$100.00} 2. On XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark made a new billing error, possibly in a failed attempt to correct the previous one. For an unknown reason, they charged me {$62.00} for the billing cycle XXXX instead of roughly {$99.00} that they were supposed to, as shown by the attached "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX XXXX '' Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX Firstmark owed me {$100.00} - ( $ XXXX {$62.00} ) = {$66.00}. 

3. For the billing cycle XXXX, even though the corresponding "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX XXXX shows an incorrect amount of {$62.00}, Firstmark actually charged me the correct amount of {$89.00}, which can be verified through "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Payment History - exported on XXXX XXXX and my XXXX statement "" Evidence # XXXX - XXXX statement XX/XX/XXXX XXXX '' Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark owed me the same {$66.00} as at the end of the previous billing cycle. 

4. On XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark made the next billing error : added an unexplained "" Past Due Amount '' of {$27.00} and an unexplained "" Fees '' of {$2.00} which, combined with my regular scheduled payment of {$94.00} resulted in a total of {$120.00} - see "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Account Home Screenshot XXXX ''. This is despite the fact that the corresponding "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark statement XXXX '' incorrectly shows the amount due of {$65.00}. Later on, Firstmark sent me TWO notifications of amount past due : "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark past due notification - XX/XX/XXXX XXXX '' and "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark past due notification - XX/XX/XXXX '' explicitly warning that these "" late payments '' "" may be reflected on your credit report. '' To minimize further damage, I chose to manually pay the erroneous {$30.00} difference ( in addition to my regular {$94.00} auto-debit ) as can be verified through "" Evidence # XXXX - XXXX  statement XX/XX/XXXX XXXX '', "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Account Home Screenshot XXXX '' and "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Payment History - exported on XXXX '' The correct amount for that XXXX billing cycle actually was {$97.00}, which can be manually checked as ( {$43000.00} * 2.71 % / XXXX ) * XXXX = {$97.00}. Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark owed me {$66.00} + ( $ XXXX {$97.00} ) = {$93.00}. 

5. On XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark made the next error, this time, I suspect, maliciously in retaliation to the detailed email complaint that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX. They discarded my last two {$30.00} and {$94.00} payments for the total of {$120.00}, i.e., "" unapplied '' {$120.00} from the previous partially erroneous interest and fees but did not return {$120.00} back to my XXXX checking account. That caused Firstmark web site to erroneously display {$120.00} as "" past due '' - see "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Account Home Screenshot XXXX, '' which prompted me to repeat the {$120.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX to avoid negative credit reporting - see "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Account Home Screenshot XXXX ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark mailed me a "" Notification of Returned Payment '' ( see "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark 'Notification of Returned Payment'.png '' ), erroneously ( or maliciously ) claiming that the payment was "" returned '' "" because your financial institution was unable to process it. '' That statement is false. Firstmark DID receive this payment, as proven by the attached "" Evidence # XXXX - XXXX statement XX/XX/XXXX XXXX '' showing these payments as processed on XX/XX/XXXX, as well as by "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Payment History - screenshot on XXXX '', "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Account Home Screenshot XXXX '', "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark Payment History - exported on XXXX XXXX XXXX and even by that same "" Evidence # XXXX - Firstmark 'Notification of Returned Payment'.png '' stating earlier that the payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX. Firstmark never returned that {$120.00} payment. Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark owed me {$93.00} + {$120.00} = {$210.00}.

I am currently a XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I have been making payments through the automatic debit system for the interest rate deduction. My XXXX XXXX XXXX is 7 years long, 2 years of which are dedicated to research. These two research years spanned from XXXX XXXX XXXX. During this time, under a 100 % institutional scholarship, I completed coursework toward a XXXX XXXX. As a XXXX, I was still employed and salaried by the hospital, and thus in XXXX as usual I submitted my yearly employment certification form as well as my yearly income based repayment recertification form, both of which were approved and a new payment amount calculated.

05/24/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"There are two student loans that I took out with XXXX while I was in college from XXXX to XXXX. I was successfully paying on these loans after graduation until XXXX when my parents filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, because my dad is the co-signer on the two student loans they were pulled into their bankruptcy. The bankruptcy lawyer told us to leave the loans as is because they will pay out in the bankruptcy. 

The XXXX student loans were discharged in Bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached the discharge papers and highlighted the two Firstmark loans as well as the courts sentence stating that the unpaid amounts have been discharged. These are non-qualified private student loans, so they are not exempt from discharge under the bankruptcy code. They were taken out as direct consumer student loans, not certified by the school ( as you will see in the application that Firstmark has given me, and I've attached on the right-hand side there is no school certification information ), and they were in excess of my scholarship and the federal student loans that covered by tuition. No further petition needs to be filed with the court for the discharge, according to the bankruptcy code any non-qualified private student loans are automatically discharged. I've told Firstmark this multiple times, but they just say that student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, which is only accurate for federal and private qualified student loans. 

In addition to that, Firstmark is saying that these two loans were not discharged in bankruptcy and that I still owe them. I have been trying to get documentation for proof of debt from Firstmark for several months now because I do not believe I owe these loans. I've asked Firstmark customer service for this documentation directly several times and I either receive the same documents over and over, which are not enough to satisfy proof of debt, or I don't get any answer at all. Not only that, but I have filed multiple disputes with all three credit bureau 's, and every time the loans come back as verified. I am very confused as to how that can be possible when Firstmark can't provide the appropriate and complete documentation to me. 

I called XXXX  and asked a dispute specialist if they could provide me with the proof of debt that is required for Firstmark to report these to the credit bureau under the FCRA, and XXXX  said they do not receive anything from Firstmark. The agent explained that XXXX  just passes the dispute on and Firstmark says they've verified it, so XXXX  leaves it on my credit report.

I sent Firstmark a 623 dispute letter requesting that they investigate the loans and that they provide me with all proof and documentation of their investigation as well as what they've found in their investigation. I received a letter in the mail today from Firstmark stating that they are not going to investigate the dispute because it was frivolous. They did not provide any further documentation with the letter, nor did they provide any documentation around their previous investigations or any proof that they've ever done any sort of investigation on these loans. 

To this date the ONLY documentation Firstmark has provided me is ( 1 ) student loan application that was electronically signed ( there are two separate student loans this complaint pertains to ), ( 1 ) word document that has blanked out areas, and different fonts that claims to be a conditional letter of approval from XXXX, but I could type this up in Word if I wanted to. ( 1 ) generic promissory note that does not have my signature on it, and does not tie itself to my loan application or accounts in any way. The first page of the generic promissory note under the 'promise to pay ' section states that a conditional letter of approval and/or a promissory note will be sent with each subsequent loan, even under a master student loan promissory note. I have not received this documentation for the 2nd student loan after multiple requests. 
At this point, Firstmark has failed to provide ANY documentation for one of these loans, they can not even provide documentation that I even applied for a 2nd loan with XXXX.

05/20/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have private students loans with Navient since XXXX. These loans were at one time Federal Student Loans with Sallie Mae. Because I was not making a lot of money they encouraged me to defer these loans. I was not offered and income based loan program and somewhere around XXXX after reading some information applied for IDP and began paying the loans back. At some point in XXXX when I lost my job and filed for bankruptcy I called Navient to find out if these loans could be settled in the filing and they told me that students loans do not qualify for bankruptcy. They suggested I put these loans into forbearance until after the proceedings. At the time I was not offered any other option. Fast forward to a few months ago when the pandemic hit. I contacted Navient because again I was unemployed due to covid and they told me because these were private loans they were not apart of the pandemic relief package. I had been paying over 10 years and thought I would try to apply for loan forgiveness under the IDP. I went on line at the time and applied for this program. It was denied. I didn't understand why but kept making payments. It seemed I had been making payments forever on this loan and the balance only increased? The original loan amount was XXXX. I added up all my payments which amounted to XXXX and still have a XXXX balance?? I began to question Navient about these interest rates and capitalized charges and they have yet to give me a clear answer. I have spoken with a supervisor and the final answer is always "" this is why student loans are different than other amortized loans '' Apparently they charge a capitalized charge each time they defer/forbear the loan, and then charge the 6.8 % on top of the entire amount making it impossible to ever pay back the loan in its entirety ; as far as I can tell. I then ask her why there was another capitalized charge of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and she claimed that I filled out an unemployed deferment form, which created the charge? I never recall doing that but told her I did fill out a forgiveness loan application and I would like to see the signature and she said it was electronic, so no signature. I asked her why if I had filled out a deferment and knew about it, would I continue to make payments on the loan, and if a capitalization charge was for non payment of the interest why was my COMPLETE payment, during that time, not going to the principle? She had no answers other than, this is how student loans work? I'm not satisfied and would like a better explanation. I also noticed that it looks as if no payments went to the principle of the loan from XXXX yet I made payments to them? I'm not sure why when I download the spreadsheet it shows XXXX payments made? I think this loan servicer is shady at best and now understand why people feel trapped by this lender. I might add that she again tried to convince me to refinance my loans or put them into forbearance if I couldn't pay them, and I told her absolutely not until I got to the bottom of this situation. As I looked deeper into the Navient on line forms, I noticed that all the documents and form I had sent them over the past uploaded or otherwise did not exist in their forms you sent us tab. So apparently any documentation that I could have sent you about my situation no longer exist, just them saying I filled out electronic forms without signatures. I might also add that she informed me that I was not able to record the conversation at the beginning, as I had ask her to do so.

I needed an actual payment to remain in qualification for the loan, as the mortgage specialist missed this loan on my report. I have since graduated. Nevertheless, while XXXX promptly put my loan back in deferral due to my in-school status, Navient is refusing to put my loan back in deferral citing that I have graduated, even though I just graduated in XXXX and am well within the grace period. As well, I believe there is currently a COVID forbearance, as well. I have emailed to no avail and tried to set up calls. Still, they are adding fees to my loan and have kept the loan in repayment. In addition to being inefficient, it seems like a shady business practice at this point since they know that recent graduates have a grace period. XXXX, there is the emergency forbearance to which all appear entitled. Additionally, we discussed this situation by phone and staff there agreed that it would be no problem to resume my in-school deferral afterward. Something is awry, and it stands in stark contrast to the exact same scenario I have with XXXX, which was handled without my ever having to email or pick up the phone again.

I am on this plan to reach the point of Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) as I work in XXXX XXXX. I am on the path to reach my 120 payments towards forgiveness when suddenly NUMEROUS payments disappeared from my account. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my annual re-certification to confirm I'm still employed in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, I received my letter outlining my total number of "" Qualifying Payments ''. I am very diligent with checking from the previous letter to compare as full & on-time payments in the past have not been calculated in ( 2 prior disputes with this company ). In XXXX when I received my letter, my total was 68 qualified payments. 

In XXXX, I sent in my re-certification again. This certification is typically done by me in XXXX, but we were prompted to re-certify as the pandemic brought on layoffs, so I re-certified earlier than usual at the request of Fedloan Servicing. This generated a letter in XXXX that I received with my updated number of Qualifying Payments. However, this letter was missing 33 qualifying payments from the letter I received just 5 months earlier AND didn't add in the 5 qualifying payments that were supposed to be calculated in through the emergency relief up to that point. 

When I called FedLoan Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). He transferred me to XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). They looked into it and saw this discrepancy. He confirmed that all of my payment have been in full and on time and didn't understand how or why they would just disappear like that. He guessed it to be a "" computer glitch '' and put in a dispute for 38 total months for review. This was the 33 missing payments that I had evidence that I paid for, and the 5 that weren't calculated in from the emergency relief bringing my total to 38 for review. 

2 months later on I called again. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with an employee of FedLoan Servicing. They told me that there has been "" no movement '' and no resolution with the disputes so far and to try back at a later date. 

3 months later on XX/XX/XXXX I called FedLoan Servicing again and spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). She transferred me to the PSLF Dept where I spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). She said the dispute is still open and there has been no movement or resolution and to try back again later. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called FedLoan Servicing again because we received an email stating that FedLoan Servicing will no longer be handling our student loans and that the transition to a new company will begin. I did not want to be transferred to a new company without resolution to this dispute for fear that it may get lost in transition, prolonging the issue. I spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ) who then transferred me to XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). I explained my concerns. XXXX assured me that it would take about a year for it all to transfer over and that we should hear back from the Dispute Department by then. I asked what happened if it didn't, and she said that the "" review would get transferred over ''. I asked to speak with the Dispute Department and they told me that they "" don't accept phone calls '' and that I just have to wait and to try back again at the end of XXXX. 

On XXXX I called FedLoan Servicing and spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ) who transferred me to XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ) who said that there is still "" no movement '' with my dispute. I asked to speak with someone else. They sent me to the "" Service Recovery '' department where I spoke with XXXX ( Employee IE # XXXX ). He sent an email to the Dispute Department to add me to the "" escalated list '' since it's 7 months and I haven't heard a word about the approximately {$10000.00} worth of Qualifying Payments that disappeared from my account.

I have repeatedly requested the balance be reevaluated and told them that if there was a small remaining balance, I would gladly pay it. Each time I speak with a representative or specialist, they have little to no record of past communication, written or verbal. They continue to report negative information on my credit, and every time I try to dispute the debt reflected on their core system, I am told that I am responsible for providing documentation supporting that I don't owe this debt and that they are not required to keep any documentation older than one year. At one point I provided a claims specialist named XXXX with several statements showing that the loan was in the repayment period for a time when their records showed interest only.

09/28/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"The following complaints are being made against FedLoan 's handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and their practice of determining what payment is eligible vs ineligible. 

Complaint # 1 : I have been employed by an XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. With this employment, I am currently involved in the PSLF program with anticipated forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. However, per FedLoan, fourteen of my payments do not qualify towards the 120 payments needed for loan forgiveness. As stated by the PSLF requirements, I have done the following : 1. Made payments after XX/XX/XXXX ( qualifying payments began XX/XX/XXXX ). 
2. Each total amount required was made in full ( based on my XXXX account history ). 
3. Each payment was made on or before the XXXX of each month ( well within 15 days of the due date ). 
4. Each payment made has been under a qualifying repayment plan ( IBR/IDR ). 
5. Each payment made has been while working full-time at a qualifying employer ( XXXX  ). 

I have spoken with several reps from FedLoan wanting to remedy the issue of these fourteen "" ineligible '' payments made in XXXX ( XXXX - XXXX, XXXX ), XXXX ( XXXX - XXXX, XXXX - XXXX ). 

Below shows my communications with the company : On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). She stated she was marking all my ineligible payments for review. 

On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). He mentioned my account was still under review. He couldn't tell me how long the review process would last. He hung up on me. 

OnXXXX  spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). She mentioned the account was still under review. 

On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( # XXXX ). He mentioned that my account was under review. After I made mention that it has been under review since XX/XX/XXXX. He asked for more detail on my situation. He stated the ineligible payments were not placed under review. It was my entire account placed under review. He stated he placed my payments in question under review and that I should hear from someone soon. 

On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( # XXXX ). This was the rudest call I have experienced with FedLoan by far. She stated that my case had been closed ( though I haven't received any update about my case ). She stated that I had been late on payments starting in XXXX. I mentioned to the rep that this was incorrect. She stated that nothing was going to be changed. Asked to speak with someone else, she hung up on me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with FedLoan Rep XXXX ( # XXXX ). He stated that though I made payments on time, they were not applied to my federal loans. And in spite of what my account history states with my previous loan servicer, the payments I made in XXXX & XXXX were distributed in a way that did not go towards fulfilling my monthly balance. So, on "" FedLoan 's end '', I did not make full payments within the time frame needed to be counted as an eligible payment. He stated that the only solution he could give me would be to fill out a forbearance form for XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This would make my loans current for XX/XX/XXXX, and then my fourteen ineligible payments would be counted towards PSLF. Per rep, he was emailing the form to me "" right now ''. Also, I asked him to send the document explaining the distribution of my payments. He stated he would send it but it will take 30 days. 

I am not receptive to signing a forbearance form as I was never late with any federal loan payments. Also, it was never explained to me how this would affect my current loan status, credit report, IDR plan status, and PSLF participation. 

Complaint # 2 This company has removed the majority of communications regarding my PSLF from my account 's inbox. Some of the forms that are listed for viewing show an error. Also, there are no billing statements in my account 's inbox. 

Complaint # 3 This company has changed my eligibility date for loan forgiveness, even after a former PSLF application result shows otherwise. For example, I have one PSLF document stating I am eligible for loan forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX. Another state I'm eligible for loan forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX. A third form projects my eligibility date to be XX/XX/XXXX. On the form with the later date of eligibility for forgiveness, I have a high number of eligible payments already made. Of course, I do not agree with the dates that are given due to evidence I have showing I have made qualifying payments which should result in me being eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Complaint # 4 FedLoan does not communicate well with student borrowers. I have been promised documentation that has not been sent to me. I have sent emails inquiring about the document promised. FedLoan has not responded. On XX/XX/XXXX, while speaking to the representative, he stated he was emailing the forbearance form to me "" right now.

05/29/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Due to Covid, I took a short forbearance on my FFELP loans owned and serviced by Navient last XXXX. I did not qualify for the Ed loan forbearance or zero interest program under the Cares act. However, Navient offered their FFELP consumers the option to do a 90 day forbearance. Due to the date I requested the forbearance XXXX late XXXX XXXX my XXXX payment was pulled as Im set up on auto pay. The XXXX payment appears to only have been applied as a half payment- despite the fact I paid the full amount. I did not pay for XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, but my payments resumed as usual in XXXX of XXXX. So the forbearance in my case was actually for 60 days, not 90. Last week, I was reviewing how my payments have been applied because my balance should be lower than Navient shows. When I viewed the individual payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, 100 % of $ 658 monthly payment had been applied to interest. Nothing had been applied to the principle. Prior to the 2 month forbearance, my payments had been {$8.00} less, so I was already paying the new interest amount that had accrued during the 60 days. I inquired why nothing had been applied to principle after my payments resumed, and received a one sentence email stating it was because I took a forbearance. This seems erroneous to me. They increased my payment by {$8.00} per month for the remainder of my loan to adjust for the 60 days of interest they didnt receive, then took 4 months of payments at {$650.00} each and applied it to interest only? Im disputing this because not only do I believe that forbearance scenario was handled in error, I believe that my entire account has been mishandled.

06/29/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have been on an autopay plan with my XXXX loan servicer ( ECSI ) for years. ECSI offers a selection of calendar-based ( not due-date based ) payment dates : the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. I had a previous experience with a late fee being charged when I had my payment date set to the XXXX ( my loan due date ) when the payment fell on a weekend, and although the servicer refunded that fee after several contacts with them and the school, I adjusted my payments to be withdrawn on the XXXX of the month prior to the due date to prevent this from happening again. 

Now, after at least 2 years of consistent monthly autopayments, my autopayment date again fell on a weekend XXXX Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX ), and ECSI processed it as of Monday XX/XX/XXXX. When I noticed the next payment ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had been allotted fully to principal instead of having a portion go to interest, I contacted ECSI to find out why, and they explained that it was because my XX/XX/XXXX payment processed on XX/XX/XXXX, after my monthly statement date of XX/XX/XXXX. What ECSI did not explain at this time was that because of this, they processed the XX/XX/XXXX payment as an overpayment, instead of applying it to my regular monthly payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

ECSI did not communicate that they processed my XX/XX/XXXX payment any differently than my usual monthly payments, and didn't provide any late payment warnings/notices. I only noticed they didn't apply my autopayment to my monthly payment due when I checked my payment history on XX/XX/XXXX, as I do with every payment, and noticed a late fee had been assessed. 

I contacted ECSI to get an explanation of why my autopayment wasn't applied toward my monthly payment as usual and ask to get the fee reversed, but ECSI claimed they couldn't answer questions about payment processing or due dates, and I would need to contact my lender ( University XXXX XXXX ). The University 's Office of Student Finance representative understood what had happened and sent a ticket to ECSI on XX/XX/XXXX requesting the fee to be reversed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, having not seen the fee reversal noted in my ECSI account yet, I contacted ECSI to inquire about status and expected timeline of the ticket issued by my school/lender. ECSI acknowledged that they received the ticket on XX/XX/XXXX but it would take XXXX business days to process. 
I checked again on XX/XX/XXXX, and ECSI stated tickets take 5-10 business days to process. 
I checked again on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, it was 11 business days after the ticket was issued/acknowledged as received by ECSI, and after I'd completed an ECSI survey about their live chat experience stating I didn't feel like my issue had been or would be resolved. ECSI stated that "" the school never made a ticket ... '' At this point, my next monthly payment was due in 2 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and when I asked what I should do to get the accurate and updated loan amount prior to my payment while avoiding an additional late fee, ECSI vaguely responded that only the school can give permission for "" that '' ( what? ) and you can follow up with them tomorrow. 

ECSI did not proactively disclose when processing autopayments in non-typical ways ( ie as an overpayment, rather than monthly payments as had been the case for multiple years prior ). ECSI didn't have the knowledge required to respond to loan processing questions or resolve issues and had to refer me to the lender for information. When the school/lender created a ticket for ECSI to resolve issues, ECSI lost/denied the ticket. Collectively, ECSI 's actions or lack of action caused fees to be incorrectly incurred, and made the resolution of those fees unreasonably difficult, including not responsibly handling tickets in a timely manner before additional fees would be incurred.",None,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,MN,55104,None,Consent provided,Web,06/29/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4501989

Which did happen, but I also filled it out, sent it in ( in the presence of a federal employee ), and got a return letter of confirmation. My XXXX loan had no problem with the deferment paperwork through my local college. I said fine, I will call back Wednesday when I could go get a bank card from the halfway house and pay what I need.

01/05/21,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I graduated college in XX/XX/XXXX. My payments started in XXXX. My loan payments are handled through AES Success and they have been nothing but the absolute WORST. I originally had 4 separate loan sequences on my AES account all under my name and account number. Loan sequence # 3 was credited back to my account on XX/XX/XXXX due to a misunderstanding with my school. I fully paid off Loan sequence # 1 on XX/XX/XXXX. This left me with two remaining loans- sequence # 2 and # 4. Due to a high interest rate, I opted to refinance loan sequence # 2 with XXXX. XXXX  processed my refinancing request and paid AES on XX/XX/XXXX. AES disbursed the money incorrectly, instead of fully paying off loan sequence # 4 they paid off half of loan sequence # 2, half of loan sequence # XXXX and added my, what should have been fully refinanced, loan sequence # 5. When I spoke to AES, I was told "" it does not matter, the amount is still the same ''. When I explained it does matter because it effects my interest and it is not what was supposed to happen I was given a hard time about getting it redistributed. XXXX was great, offered to call AES and help me get it figured out. Eventually, AES started the redistribution process and told me to wait to start my monthly payments until my account was corrected and someone would contact me. However, I was never contacted but I checked my account the day my first payment was due. While AES corrected the distribution issue, they still had not address an interest rate reduction I am entitled to through XXXX XXXX loan program. 

I have been calling AES since I received my diploma to have my .75 interested rate deduction applied and each time all except two AES representatives have had no knowledge of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and tried to tell me I as incorrect. Even when I submitted proof of the documents and requirements. I am still given wrong information and have been told a "" request '' would be put in to correct the interest rate over five separate times and nothing has been done. 

When I logged into my AES account today, my loan balance had tripled. Loan sequence # 1-3 were all showing overdue balances. When I called AES I was told there was no payment history on my account and that they "" lost '' my payments and the refinancing money. Once again, was told they are "" putting in a request '' to locate over {$25000.00}. None of my payments were refunded to my bank and I spoke with XXXX who said they have not received their payment back either. 

AES is now trying to locate my money and has put a ridiculous amount of late fees on my account while also not addressing the first issue- my XXXX XXXX interest rate reduction. The majority or the representatives with the acception of three or four, have been condescending, unempathetic and could care less that they "" lost '' MY money. I have considered refinancing even if it means a high interest rate just so I don't have to deal with the criminal and unacceptable ways of AES. Funny how if I miss a payment, AES can't wait to charge me a late fee but they haven't been able to preform the services they offer for months and I'm still the one facing the consequences of the incompetent and lazy employees.",None,AES/PHEAA,FL,34689,None,Consent provided,Web,01/22/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4048121

04/29/21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a mortgage and used my XX/XX/XXXX IBR statement from FedLoan Servicing ( FLS ). As an XXXX XXXX I find it advantageous to purchase a home rather than rent XXXX rental - {$1400.00} with rental companies continuously tacking on extra fees ; mortgage - $ 975 monthly payment ). Unfortunately, I did not find a replacement house to purchase until XX/XX/XXXX. I had used my IBR statement from FLS dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ) that documented my monthly payments as {$0.00} and was preapproved for a mortgage ; however, the loan goes into underwriter and was delayed because two of the loans on the IBR statement showed a N/A in the monthly payment terms column, so the underwriter could not go forward until I get an updated letter XXXX note I have been on IBR since XXXX and have a XXXX credit score ). I contacted FLS immediately on XX/XX/XXXX and encountered a phone tech who was obviously hung over and rude who hung up on me. I called back and received a pleasant phone tech who I relayed that I needed an updated IBR letter because the one I had is dated XX/XX/XXXX and the two loans with N/A should be showing {$0.00} as the others. 

In the meantime the mortgage loan consultant is emailing me that if I do not show the two loans as {$0.00} even though the XXXX XXXX clearly states I am on IBR that he would have to use the 1 % formula of the balance of the two loans that are in forbearance due to COVID-19 that will increase the XXXX. I will most definitely lose the house due to this action. I kept calling FLS for a status and even did a chat with customer service and was assured that the request was being processed. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from FLS that stated Summary and could not believe what I had just received ( see attached ). All needed to be done was to update the two loans in the XX/XX/XXXX letter. This summary did not resemble the XX/XX/XXXX letter because everything was wiped out -- every single loan on the document and the terms showed N/A with a lot of gobbledygook below about the loan terms. I was horrified and called FLS again and they advised me that the Summary would be corrected. I stated to the tech that the Mortgage Letter in the FLS Dashboard document all the loans as {$0.00}, but does not mention anything about IBR, etc., so the mortgage companies render it useless. The IBR certification letter is the only acceptable documentation. 

I was told that I did not need to complete another recertification due to COVID-19 because the deadline had been extended, but I submitted a recertification on XX/XX/XXXX thinking this was the problem. However, I received an email this XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that the request was incomplete because I did not submit income documentation -- not true. I immediately scanned both the application and supporting documents together and resubmitted. 

A consumer/student should not have to go through this trauma from FLS ' incompetence or vindictiveness -- not sure which one. The rules are so conflicting and goes against the struggling student.",None,AES/PHEAA,AL,35124,None,Consent provided,Web,04/29/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4339227
