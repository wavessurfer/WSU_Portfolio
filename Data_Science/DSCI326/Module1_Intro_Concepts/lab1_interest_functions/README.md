# DSCI 330 Lab 1 - Interest Functions

In this lab, you will practice the programming workflow discussed in class (and outlined below) to create Python functions related to simple and compound interest.

#### Functional programming workflow

1. Make sure you understand the task and work out the solution to a few cases.  Be sure to include any important edge cases.
2. Write a `lambda` function for the computation and make sure you get the expected results for each of your worked examples.
3. Turn the `lambda` function into a `def` statement, including a doc string that follows the [Google formatting rules](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods).
4. Create a test function using your worked examples and `assert` statements.  Be sure to call this function immediately after the `def` statement to execute the tests automatically.  (We will automate this process using `py-test` in the future)

## Getting Started

To get started on this activity, you should

1. Create a personal fork of this repository.
2. Open your copy of `lab1_interest_functions.ipynb` in colab.
3. Get started on creating the function, documenting your workflow in multiple cells and saving your work to your forked repository.
